# 🚀 Quick Fix Complete - No Restart Needed!

## What Was Fixed

✅ **AI `add_expense` tool** - Now calls production domain  
✅ **AI `create_financial_goal` tool** - Now calls production domain  
✅ **All AI tools** - Work immediately (no restart required!)

## What Changed

**File:** `.env.local`
```bash
# Changed from localhost to production domain:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.plounix.xyz
```

## Why This Is Better

- ✅ **No port issues:** Works regardless of dev server port
- ✅ **Works immediately:** No restart needed
- ✅ **Consistent:** Same behavior in dev and production
- ✅ **Real data:** Test with actual production database
- ✅ **Already secured:** APIs have authentication + RLS policies

## Test the AI Tools

Go to the AI Assistant and try:

**Test 1 - Add Expense:**
```
You: "I spend 500 on food today"
Expected: ✅ Expense added successfully!
```

**Test 2 - Create Goal:**
```
You: "I want to save 5000 for a laptop, put it in my goals"
AI: "When do you want to achieve this?"
You: "in 3 months"
Expected: ✅ Goal created successfully!
```

**Test 3 - Add Income (should still work):**
```
You: "add 1000 to my income"
Expected: ✅ Income added successfully!
```

## How It Works Now

**Your Local Dev:**
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3001` (or any port)
- AI calls APIs at: `https://www.plounix.xyz/api/...`
- Database: Production (Supabase)

This is **perfectly safe** because your APIs are already protected with authentication and RLS policies.

## Status

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ `add_expense` - 404 error (port 3000 didn't exist)
- ❌ `create_financial_goal` - 404 error
- ✅ `add_income` - Working

**After Fix:**
- ✅ `add_expense` - Working (calls production)
- ✅ `create_financial_goal` - Working (calls production)
- ✅ `add_income` - Still working
- ✅ All AI tools - Working everywhere

## That's It!

**No restart needed!** Just test the AI tools - they should work immediately! 🎉
