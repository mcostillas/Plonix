# AI Date & Time Awareness Fix ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed and Deployed

## Problem

The AI assistant (Fili) was responding to "what day is today?" with placeholder text like:
```
"Today is [insert today's date]"
```

Instead of the actual date.

## Root Cause

The system prompt had date information, but it wasn't explicit enough about:
1. How to format the date when asked
2. That the AI DOES have access to current date/time
3. Instructions for common date questions

## Solution

Enhanced the system prompt in `lib/langchain-agent.ts` with:

### 1. Explicit Date & Time Information
```typescript
‚è∞ CURRENT DATE & TIME AWARENESS:
- **TODAY IS: Thursday, October 17, 2025**
- **Current time: 11:36 AM**
- Current year: 2025
- Current month: October
- Current day of week: Thursday
```

### 2. Specific Instructions for Date Questions
```
üö® **WHEN USER ASKS "what day is today?" or similar:**
- ALWAYS respond with the ACTUAL date shown above
- Format: "[Day of week], [Month] [Day], [Year]"
- Example: "Today is Thursday, October 17, 2025"
- NEVER use placeholders like "[insert today's date]"
- NEVER say you don't have access to current date - YOU DO!
```

### 3. Dynamic Date Generation
The system prompt now uses JavaScript to generate current date/time:
```javascript
${new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-PH', { 
  weekday: 'long', 
  year: 'numeric', 
  month: 'long', 
  day: 'numeric' 
})}
```

## What Changed

### Before
```
User: "what day is today?"
AI: "Today is [insert today's date]"
```

### After
```
User: "what day is today?"
AI: "Today is Thursday, October 17, 2025"
```

### Financial Context
```

AI: "Many companies in the Philippines pay on the 15th and 30th of the month. 
Since today is October 17, 2025, if you're paid bi-monthly, your next 
payday would be October 30th!"
```

User: "I want to save ‚Ç±10,000 in 3 months"
AI: "Great goal! Since today is October 17, 2025, in 3 months would be 
January 17, 2026. That means you need to save about ‚Ç±3,333 per month."
```
