# Deployment Error Fix - Admin Routes

## Problem
The deployment was failing during the static export phase with errors in:
- `/api/admin/stats/route.js`
- `/api/admin/logout/route.js`
- `/api/admin/session/route.js`
- `/api/admin/check/route.js`

## Root Cause
These routes use the `cookies()` function from `next/headers` (via `lib/admin-auth.ts`), which is a dynamic function that requires a runtime environment. During static export, Next.js tries to pre-render all routes, but these routes fail because there's no request context available at build time.

## Solution
Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all admin API routes to tell Next.js that these routes must be rendered dynamically at runtime and should not be statically exported.

## Files Fixed
1. ✅ `app/api/admin/stats/route.ts` - Added dynamic export
2. ✅ `app/api/admin/logout/route.ts` - Added dynamic export
3. ✅ `app/api/admin/session/route.ts` - Added dynamic export
4. ✅ `app/api/admin/check/route.ts` - Added dynamic export

## Changes Made
Each file now includes:
```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
```

This line is added right after the imports and before the route handler functions.

## Testing
After deploying these changes:
1. Build should complete successfully without errors
2. Admin routes will work correctly at runtime
3. Cookie-based authentication will function as expected

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes
2. Push to GitHub
3. Vercel will automatically redeploy
4. Verify admin functionality works in production
