# Project Organization Cleanup

## Date: October 21, 2025

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Created Documentation Folder
- Created new `documentation/` folder in project root
- Centralized location for all documentation files

### 2. ✅ Moved MD Files
Moved all markdown files from root directory to `documentation/` folder:
- ADMIN_TEST_CHECKLIST.md
- AI_DATE_TIME_FIX.md
- AI_TOOLS_WORKING.md
- CHAT_HISTORY_FIX.md
- CRITICAL_BUGS_FIX_BATCH2.md
- CRITICAL_FIX_CHECKLIST.md
- CRITICAL_STATUS_REPORT.md
- DARK_MODE_TODO.md
- DEBUGGING_PRODUCTION.md
- DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
- DEPLOYMENT_ERROR_FIX.md
- DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md
- FAVICON_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- FEATURE_STATUS_REPORT.md
- FIX_PRODUCTION_NOW.md
- JOYRIDE_TEST_GUIDE.md
- JOYRIDE_TOUR_PERSISTENCE.md
- LANDING_PAGE_IMPROVEMENTS.md
- LOADING_COMPONENTS_GUIDE.md
- NEXT_STEPS_EMAIL.md
- OG_IMAGE_GUIDE.md
- ONBOARDING_REMOVED.md
- PIGGY_BANK_ICON_GUIDE.md
- PUSH_COMPLETE.md
- RESTART_GUIDE.md
- RESTART_SERVER_NOW.md
- SMTP_SETUP_SIMPLE.md
- TEST_NOW.md
- URGENT_AI_TOOLS_FIX.md
- VERCEL_FIX_URGENT.md
- VERCEL_REDEPLOY_NOW.md

**Exception:** `README.md` was kept in the root directory (as it should be)

### 3. ✅ Deleted SQL Files
Removed all SQL files from:
- `docs/` directory - All schema and migration files deleted
- `data/` directory - Removed learning-content-seed.sql

**Note:** SQL files in `backups/` folder were preserved for safety

## New Structure

```
Plounix_prototype/
├── README.md (kept in root)
├── documentation/ (NEW - contains all MD docs)
│   ├── ADMIN_TEST_CHECKLIST.md
│   ├── AI_DATE_TIME_FIX.md
│   ├── DEPLOYMENT_ERROR_FIX.md
│   └── ... (all other MD files)
├── docs/ (cleaned - no SQL files)
├── data/ (cleaned - no SQL files)
├── backups/ (preserved)
└── ... (other project files)
```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Root Directory** - Reduced clutter in project root
2. **Better Organization** - All documentation in one place
3. **Removed Redundancy** - Deleted outdated SQL files (backups are preserved)
4. **Professional Structure** - More organized for collaboration and maintenance

## SQL Files Status

- ❌ Deleted from `docs/` (38+ files removed)
- ❌ Deleted from `data/` (1 file removed)
- ✅ Preserved in `backups/` (all migration packages intact)

## Next Steps

If you need any SQL files in the future:
1. Check `backups/migration-package-2025-10-16/` for schema files
2. Create new migrations as needed
3. Keep only active migration files, archive old ones
