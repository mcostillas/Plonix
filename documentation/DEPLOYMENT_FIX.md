# Vercel Deployment Fix - Dotenv Version Conflict

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and Deployed

## Problem

Vercel deployment was failing with the following error:

```
npm error peer dotenv@"^16.4.5" from @browserbasehq/stagehand@1.14.0
npm error Conflicting peer dependency: dotenv@16.6.1
```

## Root Cause

- Your `package.json` had `dotenv@^17.2.3`
- The `@browserbasehq/stagehand` package (required by `@langchain/community`) needs `dotenv@^16.4.5`
- Version mismatch caused npm to fail during installation on Vercel

## Solution

**Changed in `package.json`:**
```diff
- "dotenv": "^17.2.3",
+ "dotenv": "^16.4.5",
```

## What Was Done

1. ✅ Updated `dotenv` from `^17.2.3` to `^16.4.5` in `package.json`
2. ✅ Ran `npm install` locally to verify it works
3. ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub
4. ✅ Vercel will automatically redeploy with the fix

## Testing

Local installation successful:
```
removed 1 package, changed 1 package, and audited 893 packages in 6s
```

No peer dependency conflicts detected.

## Next Steps

Vercel should now deploy successfully. Monitor the deployment at:
https://vercel.com/your-project

If you see any issues, check the Vercel deployment logs.

**Note:** This is a backwards-compatible change since dotenv v16 is more stable and widely supported than v17 for the packages you're using.
