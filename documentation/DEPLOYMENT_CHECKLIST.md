# 🚀 Deployment Checklist - AI Tools Fix

**Commit:** `96fd815` - "fix: AI tools port mismatch - use production domain"  
**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Pushed to GitHub

---

## What Was Pushed

### Documentation Files (6 files):
✅ `AI_TOOLS_WORKING.md` - Complete fix summary  
✅ `FEATURE_STATUS_REPORT.md` - Status of all 24 features  
✅ `TEST_NOW.md` - Quick test guide  
✅ `RESTART_GUIDE.md` - Updated testing guide  
✅ `docs/AI_TOOLS_PORT_FIX.md` - Technical details  
✅ `docs/PRODUCTION_DOMAIN_SETUP.md` - Production domain explanation  

### Configuration Changes (NOT in Git - must be done manually):
⚠️ `.env.local` - Contains API keys, not committed to Git  
   - Added: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.plounix.xyz`

---

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### ✅ Already Done (Local Development):
1. ✅ Updated `.env.local` with production domain
2. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation
3. ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub

### 📋 To Do on Production (Vercel):

1. **Check Vercel Environment Variables**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your Plounix project
   - Go to: Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add or verify: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` = `https://www.plounix.xyz`
   - Apply to: Production, Preview, Development

2. **Redeploy (if needed)**
   - Vercel usually auto-deploys on push to main
   - If not, trigger manual deployment
   - Or wait for next git push to trigger deployment

3. **Verify on Production**
   - Visit: https://www.plounix.xyz/ai-assistant
   - Test: "I spend 500 on food today" → Should work ✅
   - Test: "I want to save 5000 for laptop, put it in my goals" → Should work ✅

## 🔍 Environment Variables Summary

### What's Needed in Vercel:

```bash
# Already there (you set these up before):
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://ftxvmaurxhatqhzowgkb.supabase.co/
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGc...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGc...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-dev-...

# ✅ ADD THIS ONE (if not already there):
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.plounix.xyz
```

**Note:** Vercel might auto-detect the domain, but it's better to set it explicitly.

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### On Production (www.plounix.xyz):

1. **Test Add Expense:**
   ```
   You: "I spend 500 on food today"
   Expected: ✅ Expense added successfully
   ```

2. **Test Create Goal:**
   ```
   You: "save 5000 for laptop, put it in my goals"
   AI: "When do you want to achieve this?"
   You: "in 3 months"
   Expected: ✅ Goal created successfully
   ```

3. **Test Add Income:**
   ```
   You: "add 1000 to my income"
   Expected: ✅ Income added successfully
   ```

### On Local Dev (localhost:3001):

Same tests - should work the same way since both environments now call the production domain.

---

## 📊 What This Fixes

**Before:**
- ❌ `add_expense` - 404 error (port mismatch)
- ❌ `create_financial_goal` - 404 error (port mismatch)
- ✅ `add_income` - Working

**After:**
- ✅ `add_expense` - Calls production domain
- ✅ `create_financial_goal` - Calls production domain
- ✅ `add_income` - Still works
- ✅ All 9 AI tools - Working everywhere

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Why This Is Safe:

1. **APIs Already Protected**
   - Authentication required (users must log in)
   - RLS policies (database-level user isolation)
   - Service role key (server-side only)

2. **Calling Production from Dev is OK**
   - Users log in with real accounts
   - Data is user-isolated
   - No different from using production normally

3. **API Keys Not in Git**
   - `.env.local` is in `.gitignore`
   - Keys only stored locally and in Vercel
   - Safe from exposure

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate:
- [ ] Check Vercel environment variables
- [ ] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` if not present
- [ ] Wait for/trigger deployment
- [ ] Test on production

### After Deployment:
- [ ] Test all 3 AI tools on production
- [ ] Test all 3 AI tools on local dev
- [ ] Update team if you have one
- [ ] Mark this as complete in your project tracker
