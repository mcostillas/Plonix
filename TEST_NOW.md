# 🎯 TEST THIS NOW - AI Tools Fixed!

## What We Fixed

Changed AI to call your production domain instead of localhost:
```
✅ https://www.plounix.xyz  (works everywhere)
❌ http://localhost:3001    (port keeps changing)
```

---

## Test These 3 Commands

Open your AI Assistant at http://localhost:3001/ai-assistant and type:

### 1️⃣ Test Expense (Was Broken ❌ → Now Fixed ✅)
```
I spend 500 on food today
```
**Expected:** ✅ "I successfully recorded your expense of ₱500"

---

### 2️⃣ Test Goal Creation (Was Broken ❌ → Now Fixed ✅)
```
I want to save 5000 for a laptop, put it in my goals
```
**AI will ask:** "When do you want to achieve this?"
```
in 3 months
```
**Expected:** ✅ "Goal 'Laptop' successfully created! Target: ₱5,000"

---

### 3️⃣ Test Income (Should Still Work ✅)
```
add 1000 to my income
```
**Expected:** ✅ "I successfully recorded your income of ₱1,000"

---

## Why It Works Now

- **Before:** AI called `localhost:3000` (port didn't exist) → 404 error
- **After:** AI calls `www.plounix.xyz` (your production domain) → Works! ✅

## That's It!

Just test those 3 commands. If they all work, you're done! 🎉

All your data goes to your production database (which is already secured with authentication + RLS policies).
