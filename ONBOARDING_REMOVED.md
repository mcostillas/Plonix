# Onboarding Modal Tour Removed ✅

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** Completed and Deployed

## Overview
The multi-step onboarding modal tour has been removed from Plounix. New users will now only see the **Joyride interactive tour** which provides a more streamlined and interactive onboarding experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Onboarding Page
- **Deleted:** `app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- This was the 7-step modal tour that showed after registration

### 2. Updated Registration Flow
- **File:** `app/auth/register/page.tsx`
- **Changed:** After successful registration, users are now redirected to `/dashboard` instead of `/onboarding`
- **Message:** Updated to say "Redirecting to your dashboard..." instead of "Redirecting to setup..."

### 3. Updated Login Flow
- **File:** `app/auth/login/page.tsx`
- **Removed:** All onboarding completion checks
- **Removed:** Database query for `onboarding_completed` field
- **Removed:** Redirect to `/onboarding` for users who hadn't completed it
- **Result:** All users now go directly to `/dashboard` after login

### 4. Updated Dashboard
- **File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **Removed:** Check for `?onboarding=complete` query parameter
- **Removed:** Welcome message that appeared after completing onboarding

## New User Experience

### Before (Two Tour System)
1. User registers → Redirected to `/onboarding`
2. User sees 7-step modal tour with "Next" buttons
3. After completing, redirected to `/dashboard?onboarding=complete`
4. Dashboard shows Joyride interactive tour (if not completed before)

### After (Single Tour System)
1. User registers → Redirected to `/dashboard`
2. User sees Joyride interactive tour immediately
3. Tour is interactive and highlights actual UI elements
4. Cleaner, simpler experience

**Note:** The database still has the `onboarding_completed` field from before, but it's no longer being used. You can optionally remove it in a future database cleanup, but it's not causing any issues by being there.
