# Skill Learning Resources Feature

## Overview
The AI assistant now suggests curated learning resources (YouTube videos, websites, online courses) when users express interest in learning a skill for freelancing or career growth but lack the necessary expertise.

## How It Works

1. Express interest in freelancing/side hustles but mention lacking skills
2. Directly ask "where can I learn [skill]?"
3. Say they're "not good at" something but want to pursue it
4. Ask for courses or tutorials for a specific skill
