## 🚀 How to Set Up

### Step 1: Create the Transactions Table

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy the entire content of `docs/transactions-table-schema.sql`
6. Paste it into the SQL editor
7. Click **Run** (or press `Ctrl+Enter`)
8. ✅ You should see "Success" message

### Step 2: Verify Table Creation

1. Go to **Table Editor** in Supabase
2. You should see a new table called `transactions`
3. Click on it to see the columns:
   - `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
   - `user_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to auth.users)
   - `amount` (Decimal)
   - `merchant` (Text)
   - `category` (Text)
   - `date` (Date)
   - `payment_method` (Text)
   - `notes` (Text, nullable)
   - `transaction_type` (Text: 'income' or 'expense')
   - `created_at` (Timestamp)

### Step 3: Test the Integration

1. **Add a Transaction:**
   - Go to `/add-transaction` in your app
   - Click "Add Income" or "Add Expense"
   - Fill in the details:
     - Amount: e.g., 1000
     - Description: e.g., "Salary" or "Groceries"
     - Category: Select from dropdown
     - Date: Today's date
     - Payment Method: e.g., "Bank Transfer"
   - Click "Add Income" or "Add Expense" button
   - ✅ You should see "Income/Expense added successfully!" alert
   - ✅ The transaction should appear in "Recent Transactions" below

2. **Check the Database:**
   - Go to Supabase Table Editor
   - Open the `transactions` table
   - You should see your transaction data

3. **View on Dashboard:**
   - Go to `/dashboard` in your app
   - The "This Month Net" card should show your net savings
   - The "Spent" card should show total expenses
   - Data updates automatically!

## 🎯 Features Preserved

### ✅ Add Income Feature
Unlike the backend developer's version which removed it, **yours keeps both Income and Expense tracking!**

- Toggle between Income/Expense with clickable cards
- Visual indication of selected type (green border for income, red for expense)
- Separate tracking for each type

### ✅ Better UI/UX
- Loading states while saving
- Form validation before submission
- Real-time transaction list updates
- User-friendly error messages

### ✅ User Authentication
- Transactions are linked to logged-in users
- Each user sees only their own data
- Anonymous users can still add transactions (user_id will be null)

## 📊 Data Schema

```typescript
interface Transaction {
  id: string              // Auto-generated UUID
  user_id: string | null  // Links to authenticated user
  amount: number          // Transaction amount
  merchant: string        // Description/merchant name
  category: string        // Food & Dining, Transportation, etc.
  date: string           // Transaction date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  payment_method: string  // Cash, GCash, PayMaya, etc.
  notes: string | null    // Optional notes
  transaction_type: 'income' | 'expense'  // Type of transaction
  created_at: string      // When the record was created
}
```

---

## 🔒 Security (Row Level Security)

The transactions table has RLS policies that ensure:
- ✅ Users can only see their own transactions
- ✅ Users can only modify their own transactions
- ✅ Anonymous users can create transactions (for testing)
- ✅ No user can see other users' financial data

---

## 🎨 What's Different from Backend Developer's Version

| Feature | Backend Dev's Version | Your Version |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|
| Add Income | ❌ Removed | ✅ Kept & Enhanced |
| UI/UX | Basic | ✅ Better (loading states, validation) |
| Transaction Display | Static | ✅ Real-time from database |
| Dashboard Stats | Hardcoded ₱0 | ✅ Real calculated data |
| Code Quality | Type casts everywhere | ✅ Proper TypeScript types |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Error adding transaction: relation 'public.transactions' does not exist"
**Solution:** You haven't run the SQL schema yet. Follow Step 1 above.

### Issue: "Error adding transaction: permission denied"
**Solution:** RLS policies need to be set up. Make sure you ran the complete SQL schema.

### Issue: Transactions not showing up
**Solution:** 
1. Check if you're logged in (transactions are user-specific)
2. Clear browser cache and refresh
3. Check Supabase Table Editor to verify data is actually there

### Issue: Dashboard shows ₱0 even after adding transactions
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Check that transactions have your `user_id`
3. Try refreshing the page
