## What Happened?

The files (`forgot-password/page.tsx`, `terms/page.tsx`, `privacy/page.tsx`) were created but were **empty** - they had no content. This likely happened because:

1. Files were created but content wasn't saved
2. Content wasn't committed to git
3. Files were accidentally cleared

**Solution:** All three pages have been fully recreated with comprehensive, production-ready content.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Forgot Password flow:**
   - Visit `/auth/forgot-password`
   - Enter email and submit
   - Check email for reset link
   - Click link and verify redirect to `/auth/reset-password`

2. **Review legal content:**
   - Have a legal professional review Terms and Privacy pages
   - Adjust contact information if needed
   - Add actual company address if required

3. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx app/terms/page.tsx app/privacy/page.tsx
   git commit -m "feat: Add comprehensive Forgot Password, Terms & Conditions, and Privacy Policy pages"
   git push origin main
