# AI Monthly Bills Data Retrieval

## Overview
Enhanced the `get_financial_summary` tool to include monthly bills (recurring scheduled payments) data, enabling Fili to provide comprehensive budgeting advice that accounts for both one-time transactions and recurring financial obligations.

## Why This Enhancement?

**Problem:**
- AI could only see one-time income/expense transactions
- Could not account for recurring monthly bills in budgeting advice
- Could not answer "What are my monthly bills?" or "How much are my fixed expenses?"
- Incomplete financial picture led to less accurate savings recommendations

**Solution:**
- Added scheduled_payments table query to get_financial_summary tool
- Calculate total monthly obligations and categorize by type
- Identify upcoming bills for payment reminders
- Include monthly bills in comprehensive budget advice

## Database Structure

Monthly bills are stored in the `scheduled_payments` table:

```typescript
scheduled_payments {
  id: uuid
  user_id: uuid (FK to users)
  name: string           // e.g., "Apartment Rent"
  amount: decimal        // e.g., 8000.00
  category: string       // Housing, Utilities, Subscriptions, Transportation, Insurance, Other
  due_day: integer       // 1-31 (day of month)
  description: text      // Optional notes
  is_active: boolean     // Default true
  created_at: timestamp
}
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Query Monthly Bills (`lib/langchain-agent.ts` ~line 408)

```typescript
// Fetch monthly bills (scheduled payments)
const { data: monthlyBills, error: billsError } = await supabase
  .from('scheduled_payments')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', queryData.userId)
  .order('due_day', { ascending: true })

if (billsError) {
  console.error('‚ùå Error fetching monthly bills:', billsError)
}
```

### 2. Calculate Statistics (~line 497)

```typescript
// Calculate monthly bills statistics
const activeBills = monthlyBills?.filter(b => b.is_active) || []
const totalMonthlyObligation = activeBills.reduce((sum, b) => sum + (b.amount || 0), 0)

// Group bills by category
const billsByCategory = activeBills.reduce((acc: any, b) => {
  const category = b.category || 'Other'
  if (!acc[category]) {
    acc[category] = { count: 0, total: 0, bills: [] }
  }
  acc[category].count++
  acc[category].total += b.amount
  acc[category].bills.push({
    name: b.name,
    amount: b.amount,
    dueDay: b.due_day
  })
  return acc
}, {})

// Get upcoming bills (next 7 days)
const today = new Date().getDate()
const upcomingBills = activeBills.filter(b => {
  const daysUntilDue = b.due_day - today
  return daysUntilDue >= 0 && daysUntilDue <= 7
}).map(b => ({
  name: b.name,
  amount: b.amount,
  category: b.category,
  dueDay: b.due_day,
  daysUntil: b.due_day - today
}))
```

### 3. Return Data Structure

```typescript
monthlyBills: {
  total: 4,                          // Total number of active bills
  totalMonthlyAmount: 12000,         // Total monthly obligation
  byCategory: {                      // Bills grouped by category
    Housing: {
      count: 1,
      total: 8000,
      bills: [{ name: "Apartment Rent", amount: 8000, dueDay: 5 }]
    },
    Utilities: {
      count: 2,
      total: 2000,
      bills: [
        { name: "Electric Bill", amount: 1500, dueDay: 10 },
        { name: "Water Bill", amount: 500, dueDay: 10 }
      ]
    },
    // ... other categories
  },
  upcoming: [                        // Bills due in next 7 days
    { name: "Health Insurance", amount: 1500, category: "Insurance", dueDay: 1, daysUntil: 2 }
  ],
  allBills: [                        // All active bills
    { name: "Apartment Rent", amount: 8000, category: "Housing", dueDay: 5, description: null },
    // ... all other bills
  ]
}
```
