### 4. **Better Mobile UX**

**Net Result:** Cleaner code, better UX, -70 lines of code

## 🔍 Components Still Using Modals (Intentionally)

These modals are **confirmation/warning** modals, not success modals, so they should remain:

### Confirmation Modals (Keep)
1. **`ConfirmDialog`** - Used in MonthlyBillsManager & ScheduledPaymentsManager
   - Purpose: Confirm deletion before action
   - Reason: Destructive action requires explicit confirmation

2. **`DeleteChatModal`** - Used in AI Assistant
   - Purpose: Confirm single chat deletion
   - Reason: Data loss prevention

3. **`ClearHistoryModal`** - Used in AI Assistant
   - Purpose: Confirm clearing ALL chat history
   - Reason: Major destructive action requires double confirmation

4. **`DeleteGoalModal`** - Used in Goals page
   - Purpose: Confirm goal deletion
   - Reason: User progress loss prevention

### Why These Stay as Modals:
- ❌ **Destructive actions** (delete, clear all) require explicit user confirmation
- ❌ **Blocking is intentional** to prevent accidental data loss
- ✅ **Success notifications** should be non-blocking (now using toasts)

## 📝 Notes

### Toast Usage Guidelines

**Use `toast.success()` for:**
- ✅ Item saved/updated successfully
- ✅ Item deleted successfully
- ✅ Action completed successfully
- ✅ Data synced

**Use `toast.error()` for:**
- ❌ Failed to save/update
- ❌ Failed to delete
- ❌ Network error
- ❌ Validation error

**Use modals for:**
- ⚠️ Confirm before delete
- ⚠️ Confirm before destructive action
- ⚠️ Required user input
- ⚠️ Critical information that requires acknowledgment

---

## ✨ Next Steps

1. **Test all changes** on dev environment
2. **Verify mobile responsiveness** of toasts
3. Consider adding **action buttons to toasts** (e.g., "Undo" for deletions)
4. Add **sound effects** to success toasts for accessibility
5. Implement **toast queue** if multiple actions happen quickly

---

## 🎨 Toast Styling

Toasts use the default sonner styling:
- **Success:** Green background, check icon
- **Error:** Red background, X icon  
- **Position:** Bottom-center on mobile, bottom-right on desktop
- **Duration:** 3 seconds auto-dismiss
- **Animation:** Slide in from bottom

Consistent with Plounix's indigo/gray design system.
