# AI Comprehensive User Data Retrieval

## Problem Description

**Issue:** When users asked Fili "What's my total income right now?" after adding multiple income transactions, Fili would:
1. Only reference the most recent conversation instead of querying actual database
2. Misinterpret "check my income" as a request to ADD another income transaction
3. Create duplicate transactions when user was just asking for information
4. Had NO ability to check learning progress, goals, or challenges

**Example:**
- User added ₱2,000 income (Other Income)
- User added ₱5,000 income (Remittance) 
- User asked: "What's my total income right now?"
- Fili responded: "₱2,000" (only from conversation memory)
- User clarified: "Check the income not just based on conversation"
- Fili interpreted this as: "Add another ₱2,000 income" ❌
- Result: Total became ₱9,000 instead of correct ₱7,000

## Root Cause

The AI agent had tools to **ADD** data but **NO TOOL to QUERY/FETCH** existing data from the database. This caused:
- Reliance on conversation memory only
- No access to actual financial, goals, learning, or challenges data
- Misinterpretation of query requests as add requests
- No holistic view of user progress

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Comprehensive Tool: `get_financial_summary`

Enhanced the tool to fetch **ALL user data** from the database:
- ✅ Financial transactions (income & expenses)
- ✅ Goals (active, completed, progress)
- ✅ Learning modules (completed modules, progress percentage)
- ✅ Challenges (active, completed, details)

**Tool Definition:**
```typescript
new DynamicTool({
  name: "get_financial_summary",
  description: "**CRITICAL: Use when user asks about income, expenses, balance, financial totals, goals progress, learning progress, or challenges.** Fetches comprehensive data including: transactions, goals, learning modules, and challenges.",
  func: async (input: string) => {
    // Fetches from multiple Supabase tables:
    // - transactions
    // - goals  
    // - learning_reflections
    // - user_challenges (with challenge details)
  }
})
```

**What it does:**
1. Connects to Supabase using service role key
2. Queries multiple tables:
   - `transactions` - All income and expense records
   - `goals` - User's savings goals with progress
   - `learning_reflections` - Completed learning modules
   - `user_challenges` - Active and completed challenges
3. Calculates comprehensive statistics:
   - **Financial:** Total income, expenses, balance
   - **Goals:** Total goals, completed, active, amounts, progress %
   - **Learning:** Modules completed out of 16 total, progress %
   - **Challenges:** Active, completed, and total challenges
4. Returns recent items from each category
5. Provides formatted comprehensive summary message

### 2. Updated System Prompt

Added **CRITICAL instructions** to the AI agent for all data types:

```
**CRITICAL: When user asks about CURRENT status, progress, or data, ALWAYS use get_financial_summary tool FIRST:**

FINANCIAL DATA:
- "What's my total income?"
- "What's my balance?"

GOALS DATA:
- "What are my goals?"
- "How much have I saved?"

LEARNING DATA:
- "How many modules have I completed?"
- "What's my learning progress?"

CHALLENGES DATA:
- "What challenges am I doing?"
- "How many challenges completed?"

COMBINED:
- "Show me my progress"
- "How am I doing overall?"
```

### 3. Emphasized Query vs Add Intent

Made it clear to the AI:
- **Query requests** = Use `get_financial_summary`
- **Add requests** = Use `add_income` or `add_expense`

The AI now differentiates between:
- ❓ "What's my income?" → **Query** → Use get_financial_summary
- ➕ "Add 2000 to my income" → **Add** → Use add_income

## Testing Scenarios

## Files Modified

1. **lib/langchain-agent.ts**
   - Enhanced `get_financial_summary` tool to fetch from multiple tables
   - Added queries for: transactions, goals, learning_reflections, user_challenges
   - Added comprehensive calculations for all data types
   - Updated system prompt with instructions for all data categories (lines ~715-805)

## Technical Details

### Database Queries
```typescript
// Transactions
const { data: transactions } = await supabase
  .from('transactions')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', queryData.userId)
  .order('date', { ascending: false })

// Goals
const { data: goals } = await supabase
  .from('goals')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', queryData.userId)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })

// Learning Progress
const { data: learningProgress } = await supabase
  .from('learning_reflections')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', queryData.userId)

// Challenges
const { data: challenges } = await supabase
  .from('user_challenges')
  .select('*, challenges(*)')
  .eq('user_id', queryData.userId)
  .order('joined_at', { ascending: false })
```

### Calculations
```typescript
// Financial
const totalIncome = transactions
  ?.filter(t => t.transaction_type === 'income')
  .reduce((sum, t) => sum + (t.amount || 0), 0) || 0

const totalExpenses = transactions
  ?.filter(t => t.transaction_type === 'expense')
  .reduce((sum, t) => sum + (t.amount || 0), 0) || 0

const balance = totalIncome - totalExpenses

// Goals
const totalGoals = goals?.length || 0
const completedGoals = goals?.filter(g => g.is_completed)?.length || 0
const totalSavedTowardsGoals = goals?.reduce((sum, g) => sum + (g.current_amount || 0), 0) || 0
const goalsProgressPercentage = ((totalSavedTowardsGoals / totalGoalAmount) * 100).toFixed(1) + '%'

// Learning
const completedModules = learningProgress?.length || 0
const totalModules = 16 // Total available modules
const learningPercentage = ((completedModules / totalModules) * 100).toFixed(1) + '%'

// Challenges
const activeChallenges = challenges?.filter(c => c.status === 'active' || c.status === 'in_progress')?.length || 0
const completedChallenges = challenges?.filter(c => c.status === 'completed')?.length || 0
```
