# Goals Feature - Backend Integration Complete ✅

## Overview
The Goals feature has been successfully integrated with Supabase backend, providing real database persistence with auto-completion triggers and real-time updates.

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Types (lib/database.types.ts)
Added complete TypeScript type definitions for goals table:
```typescript
goals: {
  Row: {
    id: string
    user_id: string | null
    title: string
    target_amount: number
    current_amount: number
    category: string
    deadline: string | null
    icon: string
    color: string
    description: string | null
    status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'paused'
    created_at: string
    updated_at: string
  }
  Insert: { ... }
  Update: { ... }
}

// Helper types
type Goal = Database['public']['Tables']['goals']['Row']
type GoalInsert = Database['public']['Tables']['goals']['Insert']
type GoalUpdate = Database['public']['Tables']['goals']['Update']
```

### 2. SQL Schema (docs/goals-table-schema.sql)
Complete database schema with:
- **13 columns** including user_id FK, amount tracking, deadline, status
- **RLS Policies** for user data isolation (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- **3 Indexes** for performance (user_id, status, deadline)
- **Auto-completion Trigger** - Automatically marks goal as 'completed' when current_amount >= target_amount
- **Auto-timestamp Trigger** - Updates updated_at on every change

### 3. Goals Page Integration (app/goals/page.tsx)
Complete rewrite with real backend operations:

#### Added Features:
- ✅ **User Authentication** - Uses getCurrentUser() from auth
- ✅ **Real-time Data Fetching** - useEffect to load goals from database
- ✅ **Create Goals** - INSERT into Supabase with validation
- ✅ **Update Progress** - UPDATE current_amount with prompt dialog
- ✅ **Delete Goals** - DELETE with confirmation
- ✅ **Loading States** - Disabled buttons during operations
- ✅ **Status Display** - Shows active/completed/paused status
- ✅ **Progress Bars** - Real-time visual progress tracking
- ✅ **Category System** - Preserved existing icon/color categories

#### Key Functions:
```typescript
fetchGoals() - SELECT all user goals ordered by created_at
handleCreateGoal() - INSERT new goal with validation
handleUpdateProgress(goal, addAmount) - UPDATE current_amount
handleDeleteGoal(goalId) - DELETE with confirmation
```

## Database Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run SQL Schema
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Open `docs/goals-table-schema.sql`
3. Copy and paste the entire SQL
4. Click "Run" to execute

### Step 2: Verify Table Creation
Check that the following were created:
- ✅ `goals` table with 13 columns
- ✅ 4 RLS policies (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- ✅ 3 indexes (goals_user_id_idx, goals_status_idx, goals_deadline_idx)
- ✅ 2 triggers (update_goals_updated_at, auto_complete_goal)

### Step 3: Test Goal Operations
1. **Create Goal**: Navigate to `/goals` and click "Create Manual Goal"
2. **Add Progress**: Click "Update Progress" and enter an amount
3. **Auto-Complete**: Add enough progress to reach target - status should auto-change to 'completed'
4. **Delete Goal**: Click trash icon and confirm

## Smart Features

### 🤖 Auto-Completion
When you update progress and reach or exceed the target amount, the goal automatically:
- Changes status from 'active' to 'completed'
- Updates the updated_at timestamp
- Disables further progress updates

```sql
-- Trigger fires on UPDATE
IF NEW.current_amount >= NEW.target_amount THEN
  NEW.status := 'completed';
END IF;
```

### ⏰ Auto-Timestamps
Every time a goal is updated:
- `created_at` - Set once on INSERT
- `updated_at` - Automatically updates on every change

### 🔒 Row Level Security
Users can only:
- View their own goals (WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
- Create goals linked to their account
- Update/Delete only their own goals

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a goal with title "Emergency Fund" and target ₱50,000
- [ ] Verify goal appears in goals list with 0% progress
- [ ] Click "Update Progress" and add ₱10,000
- [ ] Verify progress bar shows 20%
- [ ] Add ₱40,000 more progress (total: ₱50,000)
- [ ] Verify status automatically changes to 'completed'
- [ ] Verify "Update Progress" button is disabled for completed goals
- [ ] Delete the test goal
- [ ] Verify goal is removed from database

## Comparison with Local State (Old Version)

| Feature | Old (Local State) | New (Database) |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Persistence | ❌ Lost on refresh | ✅ Saved in database |
| Cross-device | ❌ Device-specific | ✅ Synced across devices |
| Auto-completion | ❌ Manual | ✅ Automatic trigger |
| User isolation | ❌ No auth | ✅ RLS policies |
| Progress tracking | ❌ Local only | ✅ Real-time updates |
| Timestamps | ❌ Manual | ✅ Auto-updated |

## API Reference

### Create Goal
```typescript
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('goals')
  .insert([{
    title: 'New Goal',
    target_amount: 10000,
    current_amount: 0,
    category: 'custom',
    status: 'active',
    user_id: user?.id || null
  }])
```

### Update Progress
```typescript
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('goals')
  .update({ current_amount: newAmount })
  .eq('id', goalId)
```

### Fetch Goals
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('goals')
  .select('*')
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
```

### Delete Goal
```typescript
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('goals')
  .delete()
  .eq('id', goalId)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Dashboard Integration** - Show active goals count on dashboard
2. **Goal Analytics** - Track completion rate and average time to complete
3. **Notifications** - Alert users when approaching deadline
4. **Milestone Tracking** - Add sub-goals and checkpoints
5. **AI Integration** - Let Fili AI create personalized goals based on spending patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Goals Not Appearing
- Check that SQL schema was run successfully
- Verify RLS policies allow SELECT for authenticated users
- Check browser console for errors

### Can't Create Goals
- Ensure user is authenticated
- Check that user_id is being set correctly
- Verify INSERT RLS policy exists

### Auto-Completion Not Working
- Verify trigger `auto_complete_goal` exists
- Check that status column has CHECK constraint
- Test by manually updating current_amount >= target_amount

### Progress Update Fails
- Check UPDATE RLS policy
- Verify user owns the goal
- Check that current_amount is a valid number
