# Reflection-Based Advice Fix

## Issue Report
**Date:** January 2025  
**Reported By:** User  
**Issue:** User "Yuki" completed the budgeting learning module and asked Fili for advice based on reflection answers. Fili responded saying it has no data about reflections.

## Problem Analysis

### What Was Working ✅
1. **Data Fetching**: `get_financial_summary` tool correctly fetches learning_reflections from database
2. **Data Processing**: Tool processes reflections into `reflectionAnswers` array with all details
3. **Data Return**: Tool returns `reflectionAnswers` and `reflectionsByModule` in response
4. **Instructions Exist**: System prompt had detailed instructions on HOW to use reflection data

### Root Cause ❌
The system prompt listed many triggers for calling `get_financial_summary`:
- "Show me my progress"
- "How am I doing?"
- "Give me a summary"
- "What's my overall progress?"

**BUT it was missing the most important trigger: "Give me advice"**

When users asked for advice, the AI didn't know to call `get_financial_summary` first to fetch the reflection data, so it responded "I don't have data" even though the data was available in the database.

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made to `lib/langchain-agent.ts`

**Lines ~835-850: Added Advice Triggers**

Added explicit triggers to the `get_financial_summary` call list:

```typescript
**COMBINED DATA:**
- "Show me my progress"
- "What's my overall progress?"
- "Give me a summary"
- "How am I doing?"
- "Can I afford to save [amount]?"
- "How much money is left after bills?"
- "Give me advice" ← **MUST call get_financial_summary to get reflection answers**
- "Can you give me financial advice" ← **MUST call get_financial_summary first**
- "Help me with budgeting advice" ← **MUST call get_financial_summary to see reflections**

**YOU MUST:**
1. IMMEDIATELY call get_financial_summary tool with their userId
2. Use the ACTUAL DATA from the tool response (financial, goals, learning, challenges, **reflectionAnswers**)
3. **When giving advice, USE the user's reflection answers from learning.reflectionAnswers**
4. DO NOT rely on conversation memory alone
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Explicit Advice Triggers**: Added "give me advice", "financial advice", "budgeting advice" as triggers
2. **Bold Instructions**: Made "MUST call get_financial_summary" explicit with bold text
3. **Highlight Reflection Data**: Added **reflectionAnswers** to the list of data to use
4. **Clear Workflow**: Made it explicit that advice requests → call tool → use reflectionAnswers

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario 1: User Asks for General Advice
```
User completes budgeting module with reflections:
- Q: "What's your biggest financial challenge?"
- A: "I struggle with impulse buying, especially on food delivery"

User: "Can you give me advice on saving money?"

Fili's Workflow:
1. ✅ Recognizes "give me advice" trigger
2. ✅ Calls get_financial_summary(userId)
3. ✅ Receives reflectionAnswers array with user's actual answers
4. ✅ Uses reflection data in personalized response:

Response: "I remember you mentioned struggling with impulse buying, especially on food delivery. 
Looking at your transactions, you're spending ₱4,200 on food this month. Let's work on that specifically..."
```

### Scenario 2: User Asks About Specific Module
```
User completed emergency fund module, asks: "What should I do about my emergency fund?"

Fili's Workflow:
1. ✅ Calls get_financial_summary
2. ✅ Checks reflectionsByModule['emergency-fund']
3. ✅ References user's specific answers from that module
4. ✅ Gives advice based on their stated goals
```

### Scenario 3: User Has No Reflections Yet
```
User: "Give me advice"

Fili's Workflow:
1. ✅ Calls get_financial_summary
2. ✅ Sees reflectionAnswers array is empty
3. ✅ Responds appropriately:

Response: "I'd love to give you personalized advice! Have you completed any learning modules yet? 
Your reflection answers will help me understand your specific situation better and give tailored advice."
```

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
```
User asks for advice
    ↓
AI recognizes "advice" trigger
    ↓
AI calls get_financial_summary(userId)
    ↓
Tool queries database:
  - SELECT * FROM learning_reflections WHERE user_id = ?
    ↓
Tool processes data:
  - Creates reflectionAnswers array with all Q&A
  - Creates reflectionsByModule organized map
    ↓
Tool returns response with:
  learning: {
    completedModules: 3,
    totalModules: 8,
    progressPercentage: '37%',
    completedModulesList: ['budgeting', 'saving', 'debt'],
    reflectionAnswers: [...], ← User's actual answers
    reflectionsByModule: {...}  ← Organized by topic
  }
    ↓
AI uses reflectionAnswers in personalized advice
```

### Database Schema
```sql
learning_reflections
├── id (uuid)
├── user_id (uuid) ← Links to user
├── module_id (text) ← e.g., 'budgeting'
├── phase (text) ← e.g., 'intro', 'learning', 'reflection'
├── question (text) ← What we asked user
├── answer (text) ← What user wrote
├── sentiment (text) ← 'positive', 'neutral', 'negative'

## Verification

### Before Fix ❌
```
User: "Give me advice based on my reflections"
Fili: "I don't have access to your reflection data yet."

Why: AI didn't call get_financial_summary because "advice" wasn't in trigger list
```

### After Fix ✅
```
User: "Give me advice based on my reflections"
Fili calls get_financial_summary → receives reflections → uses them
Fili: "Based on your reflections in the budgeting module, I remember you mentioned 
struggling with impulse buying. Looking at your transactions, you're spending 
₱4,200 on food. Let's create a specific plan..."
```

### Learning Modules
- **Location**: `app/learning/` directory
- **Purpose**: Educational content with interactive reflection questions
- **Modules**: Budgeting, Saving, Debt Management, Investing, etc.
- **Reflection Types**: Multiple choice, text input, scenario-based

### get_financial_summary Tool

## Success Metrics

### Qualitative
- ✅ Users report feeling understood by Fili
- ✅ Advice is relevant to user's actual situation
- ✅ AI references what user shared in modules
- ✅ No more "I don't have data" for users with completed modules

### Quantitative
- ✅ get_financial_summary called when "advice" keyword detected
- ✅ reflectionAnswers data present in tool response

- ✅ Reduction in user confusion/frustration

## Files Modified

1. **lib/langchain-agent.ts**
   - Lines ~835-850: Added advice triggers
   - Enhanced YOU MUST section with explicit reflection usage
   - Made "call get_financial_summary for advice" explicit

## Commits

1. `991afea` - "fix: add explicit advice triggers to call get_financial_summary for reflection-based recommendations"

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Proactive Suggestions**: AI suggests revisiting modules based on transaction patterns
2. **Progress Tracking**: AI comments on improvement since reflection answers
3. **Module Recommendations**: Suggest next module based on current challenges
4. **Reflection Reminders**: Prompt users to update reflections periodically

### Example of Proactive AI
```
Fili notices user's food spending increased 30% since completing budgeting module:

"Hey! I noticed your food spending went up to ₱5,400 this month. In the budgeting 
module, you mentioned wanting to keep it under ₱3,000. Want to revisit some strategies 
we learned? I can help create a specific plan."
```

## Notes

- This fix makes the AI's personalization feature actually work
- Reflections are the core of personalized advice - they must be used
- get_financial_summary is the gateway to all user context
- Explicit triggers are crucial for AI to know when to fetch data
