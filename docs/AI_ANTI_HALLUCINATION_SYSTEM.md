# üõ°Ô∏è AI Anti-Hallucination System

## Overview
Comprehensive multi-layer defense system to prevent AI from generating false information, fake links, or incorrect data.

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

### Hallucination Types Identified:
1. **Data Confusion** - AI confusing user's monthly income (30,000) with goal amount (72,000)
2. **Link Fabrication** - AI generating fake YouTube URLs that don't exist
3. **Data Miscounting** - AI saying user has 1 bill when they actually have 4
4. **Language Inconsistency** - AI switching from Filipino to English mid-conversation

---

## üîí Defense Layers

### Layer 1: System Prompt Rules (Lines 850-905)

**Location:** `lib/langchain-agent.ts` - CRITICAL DATA ACCURACY RULES section

```typescript
**üö® CRITICAL DATA ACCURACY RULES:**

1. **NEVER CONFUSE USER DATA:**
   - User's monthly_income = Their stated monthly salary (from userProfile.monthlyIncome)
   - Goal amount = target_amount for a specific goal (from goals array)
   - Monthly bills = scheduled_payments totaling monthlyBills.totalMonthlyAmount
   - NEVER say user's monthly income is a goal amount!

2. **MONTHLY BILLS COUNTING:**
   - Count ALL bills in monthlyBills.allBills array
   - Total bills = monthlyBills.total (NOT just counting one!)
   - List all bills by name when asked

3. **NO LINK HALLUCINATION:**
   - ONLY provide links from suggest_learning_resources tool results
   - NEVER make up YouTube URLs or website links
   - If you don't have a real link, say "Use the Learning section to find resources"
   - Format links as: **[Title](actual-url)** ONLY if from tool result

4. **DATA VERIFICATION:**
   - Always use get_financial_summary when asked about user data
   - Use the actual numbers from the tool result
   - Don't make assumptions about amounts or counts
```

**Location:** Lines 1250-1285 - IMPORTANT RULES section

```typescript
üö® CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES (VIOLATION = FAILURE):

1. **NEVER FABRICATE LINKS:** 
   - ONLY provide URLs that come from tool results
   - If suggest_learning_resources wasn't called, say "I can help you find resources"
   - NEVER say "search on YouTube" - always call suggest_learning_resources first

2. **NEVER GUESS USER DATA:**
   - If user asks about income/expenses/goals, ALWAYS call get_financial_summary first
   - NEVER assume amounts or counts - use actual tool data
   - If you don't have the data, ask them to add it, don't make it up

3. **NEVER CONFUSE DATA TYPES:**
   - monthly_income (from userProfile) ‚â† goal target_amount (from goals)
   - Count ALL items in arrays (bills, transactions, etc.)
   - Use exact field names from tool responses

4. **NEVER CREATE FAKE EXAMPLES:**
   - Don't mention specific products without searching
   - Don't mention specific prices without calling get_current_prices
   - Don't cite "recent news" without calling search_financial_news

5. **VERIFY BEFORE CLAIMING:**
   - If unsure, say "Let me check..." and call the appropriate tool
   - Better to call a tool twice than to hallucinate once
   - Tool results are ALWAYS more reliable than training data
```

### Layer 2: Data Architecture Fixes (Lines 437-619)

**Problem:** AI didn't have access to user's actual monthly_income

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Line 437 - Fetch user_profiles table
const { data: userProfile, error: profileError } = await supabase
  .from('user_profiles')
  .select('name, age, monthly_income, email')
  .eq('user_id', queryData.userId)
  .single()

// Line 579 - Include in tool response
userProfile: {
  name: userProfile?.name || 'User',
  age: userProfile?.age,
  monthlyIncome: userProfile?.monthly_income || 0, // ‚Üê CRITICAL FIX
  email: userProfile?.email
}

// Line 619 - Clear data labeling
Monthly Income: ‚Ç±X/month | Monthly Bills: Y bills totaling ‚Ç±Z/month | 
Net Monthly: ‚Ç±(income-bills) | Goals: amount saved
```

---

### Layer 3: Hardcoded Resource Database (lib/learning-resources.ts)

**All learning resources are manually curated and verified:**

```typescript
export const learningResourcesDatabase: Record<string, SkillCategory> = {
  contentWriting: {
    resources: [
      {
        title: 'Content Writing Tutorial for Beginners',
        url: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLW3KgdcmOc', // ‚úÖ REAL LINK
        type: 'YouTube',
        provider: 'Ahrefs',
        // ... verified metadata
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**60+ verified resources across 11 skill categories:**
- Content Writing
- Graphic Design
- Web Development
- Video Editing
- Social Media Management
- Virtual Assistant
- Online Tutoring
- E-commerce
- Teaching Tagalog
- Digital Marketing

---

### Layer 4: Tool Definitions with Strict Instructions

**Example: suggest_learning_resources tool**
```typescript
{
  name: "suggest_learning_resources",
  description: "**USE THIS TOOL** when user wants to learn any skill. 
  Returns ACTUAL clickable YouTube links, course URLs, and platform links. 
  DO NOT suggest 'search YouTube' or mention courses without using this tool first."
}
```

**Example: get_financial_summary tool**
```typescript
{
  name: "get_financial_summary",
  description: "**CRITICAL TOOL** Get comprehensive financial summary. 
  **USE THIS TO QUERY USER'S DATA - DO NOT use add_income when user asks 
  'what is my income?' or 'how much did I earn?'.**"
}
```

---

### Layer 5: Response Validation (Lines 2220-2320) - NEW!

**Post-processing validator that checks AI responses BEFORE sending to user:**

```typescript
private validateResponse(response: string, toolResults: any[]): string {
  // 1. CHECK FOR FAKE YOUTUBE LINKS
  const youtubeLinks = response.match(youtubePattern)
  if (youtubeLinks && !learningToolCalled) {
    // Remove fake links
    validatedResponse = response.replace(youtubePattern, 
      '[Learning resources available in the Learning section]')
  }
  
  // 2. CHECK FOR SUSPICIOUS NUMBER PATTERNS
  if (hasLargeNumbers && !financialToolCalled) {
    warnings.push('Financial data mentioned without get_financial_summary call')
  }
  
  // 3. CHECK FOR GENERIC "SEARCH YOUTUBE" SUGGESTIONS
  if (/search (?:for|on) youtube/gi.test(response)) {
    validatedResponse = response.replace(pattern, 
      'let me find specific resources for you in our Learning section')
  }
  
  // 4. CHECK FOR FABRICATED PLATFORM LINKS
  if (/https?:\/\/(?:www\.)?example\.com/gi.test(response)) {
    validatedResponse = response.replace(pattern, '[Available in the platform]')
  }
  
  return validatedResponse
}
```

**What it catches:**
- YouTube links without `suggest_learning_resources` being called
- Large numbers mentioned without `get_financial_summary` being called
- Generic "search YouTube" suggestions
- Placeholder/fake URLs (example.com, placeholder.com)
- [link] or [url] placeholders

---

### Layer 6: Language Consistency Rules (Lines 778, 1260, 1303)

**Problem:** AI was switching from Filipino to English based on user's message language

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Line 1303 - Strong enforcement at top of prompt
**üåê LANGUAGE CONSISTENCY RULE (CRITICAL):**
**${languageInstruction}**
**NEVER switch languages mid-conversation! Maintain the same language 
throughout the entire conversation, regardless of what language the user 
uses in their messages.**

// Line 778 - Added to PERSONALITY section
- **CRITICAL: NEVER switch languages mid-conversation - maintain language consistency**

// Line 1260 - Changed conflicting rule
// OLD: 4. Match user's language preference (if they speak English, respond in English)
// NEW: 4. MAINTAIN LANGUAGE CONSISTENCY - Never switch languages mid-conversation
```

## üß™ Testing Protocol

### Test Case 1: Monthly Income Accuracy
```
User: "What's my monthly income?"
Expected: "‚Ç±30,000 per month" (from userProfile.monthly_income)
‚ùå BUG: Would say "‚Ç±72,000" (confused with goal amount)
‚úÖ FIX: Fetches user_profiles.monthly_income correctly
```

### Test Case 2: Bills Counting
```
User: "How many monthly bills do I have?"
Expected: "You have 4 monthly bills totaling ‚Ç±5,300"
‚ùå BUG: Would say "1 bill"
‚úÖ FIX: Counts ALL items in monthlyBills.allBills array
```

### Test Case 3: Link Fabrication
```
User: "Where can I learn video editing?"
Expected: Actual YouTube links from database
‚ùå BUG: Would provide fake/dead YouTube URLs
‚úÖ FIX: Only returns hardcoded verified links from learning-resources.ts
```

### Test Case 4: Language Consistency
```
User starts in Filipino: "Kumusta? Paano mag-save?"
User switches to English: "how much should I save?"
Expected: AI continues in Taglish
‚ùå BUG: AI would switch to pure English
‚úÖ FIX: Maintains initial language throughout conversation
```

### Test Case 5: Generic Search Suggestions
```
User: "How do I learn Python?"
‚ùå BAD: "You can search on YouTube for tutorials"
‚úÖ GOOD: Calls suggest_learning_resources and provides actual links
```

### Test Case 6: Data Without Tool Call
```
User: "How much have I saved?"
‚ùå BAD: AI guesses "You've saved around ‚Ç±10,000"
‚úÖ GOOD: Calls get_financial_summary first, then uses actual data
```

## üîß Maintenance Guidelines

### When Adding New Tools:
1. Include explicit "DO NOT hallucinate" instructions in description
2. Specify EXACT use cases and keywords that trigger the tool
3. Define required parameters clearly
4. Add validation in `validateResponse()` if tool returns URLs or data

### When Adding New Learning Resources:
1. Manually verify ALL URLs work
2. Include provider, difficulty, duration metadata
3. Update `findLearningResources()` search patterns
4. Test that suggest_learning_resources returns the new resources

### When Modifying System Prompt:
1. Keep CRITICAL rules sections at the top
2. Use bold, caps, and emojis for emphasis on critical rules
3. Provide specific examples of what NOT to do
4. Test with known hallucination triggers

### Monthly Audits:
1. Check all YouTube links in `learning-resources.ts` are still valid
2. Review validation logs for new hallucination patterns
3. Test with edge cases (empty data, conflicting data)
4. Verify language consistency across long conversations

---

## üö® Known Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Multiple Goals with Same Amount
**Scenario:** User has two goals with target_amount = 50,000
**Risk:** AI might confuse which goal user is referring to
**Mitigation:** get_financial_summary returns ALL goals with full context

### Edge Case 2: User Manually Switches Language Mid-Conversation
**Scenario:** User types "Switch to English please"
**Current Behavior:** AI maintains initial language (by design)
**Future Enhancement:** Add explicit language switching command

### Edge Case 3: Learning Resource Not in Database
**Scenario:** User asks about obscure skill not in our 60+ resources
**Current Behavior:** Returns beginner-friendly alternatives
**Mitigation:** Suggest general platforms (Coursera, Udemy) instead of fabricating

### Edge Case 4: Tool Failure
**Scenario:** Supabase query fails or times out
**Current Behavior:** Returns error JSON, AI must handle gracefully
**Mitigation:** Tool responses include success: false with error messages

---

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Priority 1: Link Verification API
- Integrate link checker to verify URLs are still active
- Automatically flag dead links in database
- Periodic automated verification

### Priority 2: Fact-Checking Layer
- Cross-reference AI claims with tool data
- Flag numerical discrepancies before sending response
- Log and alert on validation failures

### Priority 3: User Feedback Loop
- Add "Report Incorrect Info" button
- Track hallucination reports per conversation
- Automatic prompt tuning based on reported issues

### Priority 4: A/B Testing Framework
- Test different prompt variations
- Measure hallucination rates per variant
- Optimize based on real user interactions

---

## üéì Best Practices for Developers

1. **Never Trust AI Memory** - Always fetch fresh data from tools
2. **Validate Everything** - Links, numbers, claims - validate before sending
3. **Be Specific in Prompts** - Use bold, caps, examples for critical rules
4. **Hardcode When Possible** - Real data > AI generation
5. **Log Extensively** - Track what tools were called and why
6. **Test Edge Cases** - Empty data, conflicting data, missing data
7. **Monitor Production** - Track hallucination reports from real users

---

## üìû Support

If you discover a new hallucination pattern:
1. Document the exact user input and AI response
2. Identify which layer failed to catch it
3. Add validation rule to `validateResponse()`
4. Update system prompt with specific example
5. Add test case to this document
