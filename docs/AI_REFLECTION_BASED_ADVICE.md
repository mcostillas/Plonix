# AI Reflection-Based Personalized Advice

## Feature Overview

Fili now retrieves and analyzes user's **learning reflection answers** to provide deeply personalized financial advice. Instead of generic recommendations, Fili can reference what users wrote during their learning modules to give contextual, relevant guidance.

## How It Works

### 1. Learning Reflections Database

When users complete learning modules, they answer reflection questions in three phases:
- **Learn**: Understanding check questions
- **Apply**: Practical application scenarios  
- **Reflect**: Personal insights and commitments

These answers are saved to the `learning_reflections` table with:
- `question`: The prompt shown to user
- `answer`: User's actual response
- `sentiment`: Emotional tone (positive/neutral/negative)
- `extracted_insights`: AI-analyzed key points
- `module_id`: Which learning module
- `phase`: Which phase (learn/apply/reflect)

### 2. AI Retrieval Enhancement

The `get_financial_summary` tool now returns:

```typescript
learning: {
  completedModules: 8,
  totalModules: 16,
  progressPercentage: "50%",
  completedModulesList: [...],
  
  // NEW: Actual reflection answers
  reflectionAnswers: [
    {
      moduleId: "budgeting-basics",
      phase: "reflect",
      question: "What's your biggest financial challenge?",
      answer: "I struggle with impulse buying, especially online shopping",
      sentiment: "concerned",
      completedAt: "2025-10-10"
    }
  ],
  
  // NEW: Organized by module for context
  reflectionsByModule: {
    "budgeting-basics": [
      {
        phase: "learn",
        question: "What is the 50-30-20 rule?",
        answer: "50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings",
        sentiment: "confident"
      },
      {
        phase: "reflect",
        question: "What's your biggest challenge?",
        answer: "Impulse buying online",
        sentiment: "concerned"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Personalized Advice Generation

Fili uses this data to:

#### A. Reference User's Own Words
```
User: "Help me save money"

Fili: "I remember in your budgeting module, you mentioned 
struggling with impulse buying, especially online shopping. 
Let's tackle that specifically..."
```

#### B. Connect Learning to Practice
```
User: "Should I start an emergency fund?"

Fili: "Actually, you completed the emergency fund module 
and said you wanted to save ₱20,000 for emergencies. 
That's a great goal! Let's work on making it happen..."
```

#### C. Acknowledge Progress
```
User: "How am I doing?"

Fili: "Looking at your reflections from the debt management 
module, you were worried about your ₱15,000 credit card debt. 
I can see you've paid down ₱5,000 since then - that's 
amazing progress!"
```

#### D. Address Specific Concerns
```
User: "I'm stressed about money"

Fili: "I see that in your financial wellness module, you 
mentioned feeling anxious about not having savings. Based 
on your current income of ₱25,000, let's create a realistic 
savings plan that won't add more stress..."
```

## AI Instructions

The system prompt now includes:

```
**USING LEARNING REFLECTIONS FOR PERSONALIZED ADVICE:**

1. When user asks for advice, check their reflection answers first:
   - Look at their stated financial goals from reflections
   - Review their concerns and challenges they mentioned
   - Understand their current financial situation
   - Note their learning style and comprehension

2. Personalize responses based on reflections:
   - Reference specific challenges they mentioned
   - Use their own words and phrases
   - Connect past learning to current questions
   - Acknowledge their progress and growth

3. Connect learning to practice:
   - Remind them of concepts they learned
   - Apply their reflections to current situations
   - Build on their previous commitments

4. Use their own words:
   - Makes advice feel personal and relevant
   - Shows you remember and understand them
   - Builds trust and engagement
```

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Budgeting Advice

**Reflection Data:**
- Module: `budgeting-basics`
- Question: "What makes budgeting hard for you?"
- Answer: "I never know how much I spend on food until it's too late"

**Later Conversation:**
```
User: "Can you help me budget better?"

Fili: "I remember you said tracking food expenses is tough 
because you don't realize how much you spent until later. 
I can see from your transactions you spent ₱4,200 on food 
last month. Let's set up a weekly check-in system so you 
catch it early..."
```

### Use Case 2: Savings Goals

**Reflection Data:**
- Module: `emergency-fund`
- Question: "Why do you want an emergency fund?"
- Answer: "My mom got sick last year and we had no money saved. I don't want that to happen again."

**Later Conversation:**
```
User: "Should I save or pay debt first?"

Fili: "I remember why emergency funds are important to you - 
your mom's illness taught you that lesson. Given your situation, 
I recommend building a small ₱5,000 emergency buffer first, 
THEN aggressively paying debt. Here's why..."
```

### Use Case 3: Spending Habits

**Reflection Data:**
- Module: `mindful-spending`
- Question: "When do you spend impulsively?"
- Answer: "Late at night when I'm stressed from work, I browse Shopee"

**Later Conversation:**
```
User: "I overspent again this month"

Fili: "Looking at your transactions, I see most of your 
online shopping happens between 10PM-1AM - matching what 
you shared about late-night stress shopping. Let's work 
on healthier stress relief that doesn't hurt your wallet..."
```

### Use Case 4: Financial Goals

**Reflection Data:**
- Module: `goal-setting`
- Question: "What's your biggest financial dream?"
- Answer: "I want to buy my parents a house someday"

**Later Conversation:**
```
User: "Tell me about long-term investing"

Fili: "This aligns perfectly with your dream of buying your 
parents a house! That's such a beautiful goal. Let's calculate: 
if you invest ₱5,000/month with 8% annual returns, in 15 years 
you could have ₱1.7M towards that house..."
