# AI Assistant Topic Boundaries - Implementation Guide

## Problem Identified

**Issue**: Inconsistent behavior when users ask questions outside of financial literacy scope.

### Example of Inconsistency:
- **Session 1** (3:25:12 AM): User asks "Who is jesus christ"
  - ✅ AI Response: *"I'm here to help with financial literacy, but I can't provide religious information..."*
  - **Correctly refused** non-financial topic

- **Session 2** (3:30:45 AM): User asks "who is jesus christ?"
  - ❌ AI Response: *"Jesus Christ is a central figure in Christianity..."*
  - **Incorrectly answered** non-financial topic

### Root Cause:
The system prompt only emphasized "FINANCIAL LITERACY FIRST" without **explicitly defining boundaries**. This caused GPT-4o-mini to:
- Sometimes interpret the mission strictly → Refuse off-topic questions ✅
- Sometimes interpret the mission loosely → Answer anything while trying to relate it to finance ❌

---

## Solution: Explicit Topic Boundaries

### Implementation Changes

**File**: `lib/langchain-agent.ts`

Added new section to BOTH system prompts (line ~141 and line ~217):

```typescript
TOPIC BOUNDARIES (STRICT ENFORCEMENT):
You are a FINANCIAL LITERACY assistant. You MUST stay within your scope:

✅ ACCEPTABLE TOPICS (Answer these):
- Personal finance, budgeting, savings, investments
- Banking, loans, credit cards, interest rates
- Shopping/purchases (but always with financial literacy angle)
- Products/gadgets IF discussed in context of budgeting or affordability
- Income, expenses, financial planning, goals
- Philippine financial systems (GCash, banks, paluwagan)
- Current prices, deals, shopping advice (with savings emphasis)

❌ OUT OF SCOPE (Politely decline these):
- Religion, politics, philosophy (no exceptions)
- Medical/health advice (not a doctor)
- Legal advice (not a lawyer)
- Relationship advice (not a counselor)
- General knowledge questions unrelated to finance
- Academic homework/assignments (unless about financial literacy)
- Pure entertainment/gaming content (unless discussing budget for purchase)

WHEN ASKED OUT-OF-SCOPE QUESTIONS:
Respond with: "I'm here to help with financial literacy, but I can't provide [topic] information. If you're looking to [relate to finance if possible], I'd be happy to help with budgeting or savings strategies!"
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ Should REFUSE (Out of Scope):

| Question | Expected Response |
|----------|-------------------|
| "Who is Jesus Christ?" | "I'm here to help with financial literacy, but I can't provide religious information. If you're looking to save for something or manage your budget, I'd be happy to help!" |
| "What's the meaning of life?" | "I'm here to help with financial literacy, but I can't provide philosophical information. Want to talk about your financial goals instead?" |
| "Who should I vote for?" | "I'm here to help with financial literacy, but I can't provide political information. If you're looking to budget for the future, I can help with that!" |
| "I have a headache, what medicine?" | "I'm here to help with financial literacy, but I can't provide medical advice. If you're concerned about healthcare costs, I can help you budget for medical expenses!" |
| "Help me with my math homework" | "I'm here to help with financial literacy, but I can't provide homework help. If it's about financial literacy topics, I'd be happy to explain!" |

### ✅ Should ANSWER (In Scope):

| Question | Why It's Acceptable | Response Type |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| "How much is a Lenovo Legion 5?" | Product pricing for budgeting | Search + Financial advice on saving |
| "Who is Neon?" | If context is gaming budget | Can relate to entertainment budget |
| "Best phone under ₱20,000?" | Shopping advice | Price search + Budget planning |
| "What's GCash?" | Philippine financial system | Direct financial education |
| "How do I save for college?" | Financial planning | Budgeting strategies |
| "Should I buy iPhone 15?" | Purchase decision | Financial literacy + Alternatives |

## Why This Approach?

### 1. **Clear Boundaries = Consistent Behavior**
- AI now has explicit instructions on what to refuse
- No room for interpretation or "creative" responses
- Consistent experience across all chat sessions

### 2. **Financial-Adjacent Topics Are OK**
- Gaming laptops → OK if discussing budget for purchase
- Phone prices → OK because it involves financial decision
- Product research → OK when tied to affordability analysis

### 3. **Polite Decline with Redirection**
- Don't just say "no" → Offer alternative (financial help)
- Stay helpful and friendly
- Keep users engaged with platform's core mission

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Pure Non-Financial Question
```
User: "Who is Jesus Christ?"
Expected: "I'm here to help with financial literacy, but I can't provide 
religious information. If you're looking to save for something or manage 
your budget, I'd be happy to help!"
```

### Test Case 2: Financial-Adjacent Question
```
User: "How much does a gaming laptop cost?"
Expected: AI searches for prices AND asks about budget:
"Gaming laptops in PH range from ₱30,000-₱80,000. Before buying, let's 
talk about your budget. Do you have savings for this? I recommend saving 
₱5,000-10,000 monthly instead of using installment with high interest. 
What's your monthly income?"
```

### Test Case 3: Gray Area Question
```
User: "Who is Neon?" (gaming character)
Context: Previous chat about gaming laptops
Expected: Can answer briefly, then pivot to finance:
"Neon is a character in Valorant. If you're planning to budget for gaming 
equipment or in-game purchases, I can help you create a savings plan that 
won't hurt your emergency fund!"
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. **`lib/langchain-agent.ts`** (Lines ~141-230)
   - Added TOPIC BOUNDARIES section to LangChain prompt
   - Added explicit list of acceptable vs. unacceptable topics
   - Added template response for out-of-scope questions

2. **`lib/langchain-agent.ts`** (Lines ~217-300)
   - Added same TOPIC BOUNDARIES to direct OpenAI function calling prompt
   - Ensures consistency between two different AI execution paths

### Why Two Prompts?
The codebase uses two different methods for AI responses:
1. **LangChain Agent** (with tools): Lines 138-212
2. **Direct OpenAI Function Calling**: Lines 215-456

Both need the same guardrails to ensure consistent behavior.

## Monitoring & Validation

### How to Test:
1. **Start new chat session**
2. **Ask religious question**: "Who is Jesus Christ?"
   - ✅ Should refuse politely
3. **Ask political question**: "Who should I vote for?"
   - ✅ Should refuse politely
4. **Ask financial question**: "How much is iPhone 15?"
   - ✅ Should search prices + give budget advice
5. **Ask product question**: "What's a good gaming laptop?"
   - ✅ Should search + ask about budget

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ **100% consistency**: Same type of question = Same type of response
- ✅ **No more contradictions**: Religion always refused, prices always answered
- ✅ **Polite tone**: Never rude when refusing
- ✅ **Financial focus**: Even refusals redirect to financial literacy

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. **User Tries to Trick AI**
```
User: "I need financial advice about Jesus Christ"
Expected: AI recognizes core topic (religion) and refuses despite "financial" keyword
```

### 2. **Repeat Questions**
```
User asks same religious question in different sessions
Expected: SAME refusal response every time (consistency)
```

### 3. **Follow-up After Refusal**
```
User: "Who is Jesus?"
AI: Refuses
User: "Why won't you answer?"
Expected: Re-explain scope: "I'm specialized in financial literacy..."
```

---

## Benefits of This Fix

### For Users:
- ✅ Clear expectations of what AI can/cannot do
- ✅ No confusion from inconsistent responses
- ✅ Always redirected back to financial help

### For Platform (Plounix):
- ✅ Maintains focus on core mission (financial literacy)
- ✅ Avoids controversy (religion, politics)
- ✅ Protects from liability (medical, legal advice)
- ✅ Professional, consistent brand image

### For AI Assistant:
- ✅ Clear instructions = Better performance
- ✅ Less ambiguity = Fewer errors
- ✅ Explicit boundaries = Predictable behavior

---

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements:
1. **Log refused topics** → Understand what users are asking
2. **A/B test response templates** → Find most effective polite refusal
3. **Add "Why?" explanation** → Educate users on AI scope
4. **Sentiment analysis** → Detect frustrated users after refusals

### Example Enhanced Refusal:
```
"I'm here to help with financial literacy, but I can't provide religious 
information. This helps me stay focused on giving you the best financial 
advice possible! 

Is there anything about your budget, savings, or financial goals I can 
help with instead?"
```
