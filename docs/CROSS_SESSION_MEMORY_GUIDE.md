# Cross-Session Memory System - Complete Guide

## The Problem
When you start a new chat session, the AI forgets everything from previous chats:
- **Session 1:** "How much is a Lenovo IdeaPad 3?" ‚Üí AI: "‚Ç±25,000"
- **Session 2 (New Chat):** "How much was that laptop?" ‚Üí AI: "I don't know what laptop you're referring to"

The AI only remembers within the CURRENT chat session, not across different sessions.

## The Solution: Cross-Session Memory

We've implemented a **persistent memory system** that:
1. ‚úÖ Automatically extracts important facts from conversations
2. ‚úÖ Stores them in a database linked to YOUR user ID
3. ‚úÖ Retrieves relevant memories when you ask questions in NEW chat sessions
4. ‚úÖ Works across ALL your chats - remember information indefinitely

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Conversation Happens
```
You: "How much is a Lenovo IdeaPad 3?"
AI: "Let me search... It's ‚Ç±25,000 on Lazada"
```

### Step 2: Memory Extraction (Automatic)
The system detects this is a **price inquiry** and stores:
```json
{
  "user_id": "your-uuid",
  "memory_type": "item",
  "category": "purchase_inquiry",
  "key": "item_lenovo_ideapad_3",
  "value": "Lenovo IdeaPad 3: ‚Ç±25,000",
  "importance": 8,
  "source_session_id": "chat_1728123_abc"
}
```

### Step 3: New Chat Session
```
You click "New Chat"
You: "How much was that laptop I asked about?"
```

### Step 4: Memory Retrieval (Automatic)
System searches memories for keywords: "laptop", "how much", "asked about"
- Finds: `"Lenovo IdeaPad 3: ‚Ç±25,000"`
- Adds to AI context: "REMEMBERED FROM PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS:"

### Step 5: AI Response
```
AI: "You asked about the Lenovo IdeaPad 3, which was ‚Ç±25,000 on Lazada!"
```

## What Gets Remembered Automatically

### 1. Price Inquiries (Importance: 8)
- Keywords: "how much", "price", "cost", "magkano"
- Stores: Item name + price
- Example: "Soundcore R50i NC: ‚Ç±725"

### 2. Income/Budget (Importance: 9)
- Keywords: "income", "salary", "earn", "sweldo"
- Stores: Monthly income amount
- Example: "Monthly income: ‚Ç±25,000"

### 3. Savings Goals (Importance: 8)
- Keywords: "save", "saving", "ipon", "goal"
- Stores: Savings target
- Example: "Savings goal: ‚Ç±50,000"

### 4. Concerns/Problems (Importance: 7)
- Keywords: "problem", "worried", "can't afford"
- Stores: User's concern
- Example: "Worried about paying rent"

### 5. Preferences (Importance: 6)
- Keywords: "prefer", "like", "want", "gusto"
- Stores: User's preference
- Example: "Prefers GCash over bank transfers"

## Database Setup (REQUIRED!)

### Step 1: Run This SQL in Supabase

```sql
-- Create the cross-session memory table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_memories (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  memory_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (memory_type IN ('fact', 'preference', 'goal', 'item', 'concern')),
  category TEXT,
  key TEXT NOT NULL,
  value TEXT NOT NULL,
  context TEXT,
  source_session_id TEXT,
  importance INTEGER DEFAULT 5,
  last_accessed TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}'
);

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_memories_user_id ON user_memories(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_memories_type ON user_memories(memory_type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_memories_category ON user_memories(category);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_memories_importance ON user_memories(importance DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_user_memories_accessed ON user_memories(last_accessed DESC);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE user_memories ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow all operations (adjust for production)
CREATE POLICY "Enable all operations for user_memories" ON user_memories
  FOR ALL USING (true);
```

### Step 2: Verify Table Created

```sql
-- Check table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'user_memories'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

---

## Code Changes (Already Implemented)

### 1. Created Memory Service (`lib/cross-session-memory.ts`)
- `extractAndStoreMemories()` - Extracts facts from conversation
- `getRelevantMemories()` - Retrieves memories relevant to current question
- `formatMemoriesForContext()` - Formats memories for AI prompt

### 2. Integrated with Authenticated Memory (`lib/authenticated-memory.ts`)
- Imports cross-session memory manager
- Loads relevant memories in `buildSmartContext()`
- Extracts memories after each conversation in `addToUserMemory()`

### 3. Enhanced AI Context
Now includes:
```
REMEMBERED FROM PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS:
- Lenovo IdeaPad 3: ‚Ç±25,000 (2h ago)
- Monthly income: ‚Ç±30,000 (1d ago)
- Savings goal: ‚Ç±100,000 (3d ago)

Recent conversation (THIS SESSION):
User: How much was that laptop?
...
```

## View Your Memories in Database

### All memories for your user:
```sql
SELECT 
  memory_type,
  category,
  key,
  value,
  importance,
  created_at
FROM user_memories
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_UUID_HERE'
ORDER BY importance DESC, created_at DESC;
```

### Count memories by type:
```sql
SELECT 
  memory_type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(importance) as avg_importance
FROM user_memories
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_UUID_HERE'
GROUP BY memory_type
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Search specific memories:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM user_memories 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_UUID_HERE' 
  AND (value ILIKE '%laptop%' OR context ILIKE '%laptop%')
ORDER BY importance DESC;
```

---

## Advanced Features

### Memory Importance Levels
- **9-10:** Critical (income, major goals)
- **7-8:** Important (purchases, concerns)
- **5-6:** Moderate (preferences, minor facts)
- **1-4:** Low priority

### Memory Expiration
Some memories can expire automatically:
```sql
-- Set expiration for time-sensitive info
UPDATE user_memories 
SET expires_at = NOW() + INTERVAL '30 days'
WHERE memory_type = 'item' AND user_id = 'your-uuid';
```

### Clear All Memories (Privacy)
```sql
-- Delete all your memories
DELETE FROM user_memories WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_UUID_HERE';
```

Or use the API:
```typescript
import { crossSessionMemory } from '@/lib/cross-session-memory'
await crossSessionMemory.clearUserMemories(userId)
```

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations:
- ‚ùå Rule-based extraction (simple keyword matching)
- ‚ùå Limited memory types (5 categories)
- ‚ùå No complex relationship tracking
- ‚ùå No automatic memory consolidation

### Planned Enhancements:
- ‚úÖ GPT-powered memory extraction (smarter)
- ‚úÖ Automatic memory importance scoring
- ‚úÖ Memory consolidation (merge similar memories)
- ‚úÖ Temporal reasoning (understand "last week", "recent", etc.)
- ‚úÖ User-initiated memory management UI
- ‚úÖ Memory export/import

---

## Privacy & Data Management

### Your Data is Secure:
- ‚úÖ Memories linked to YOUR user_id only
- ‚úÖ Other users can't see your memories
- ‚úÖ Can be deleted anytime
- ‚úÖ Stored in YOUR Supabase instance

### Clear Your Memory:
```typescript
// In future version: Add "Clear Memory" button in settings
await crossSessionMemory.clearUserMemories(user.id)
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "AI still doesn't remember"
1. Check the `user_memories` table exists (run SQL migration)
2. Look for save logs: `üíæ Saved new memory: ...`
3. Check retrieval logs: `üß† Retrieved X relevant memories`
4. Verify you're logged in (cross-session memory only works for authenticated users)

### "No memories being saved"
1. Check console for errors during save
2. Verify Supabase connection
3. Check RLS policies allow INSERT
4. Ensure user_id is being passed correctly

### "Wrong memories retrieved"
1. Keyword matching is simple - may need tuning
2. Check memory importance scores
3. Adjust relevance scoring algorithm
