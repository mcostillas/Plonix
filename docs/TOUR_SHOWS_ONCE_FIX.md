# Tour Shows Only Once Per User - Fix Guide
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🎯 Problem

The interactive dashboard tour (Joyride) was showing **every time** the user visited the dashboard, instead of only showing **once per new user**.

---

## ✅ Solution

Implemented a **dual-layer persistence system**:
1. **Database (`user_profiles.tour_completed`)** - Cross-device persistence
2. **localStorage (`plounix_tour_shown`)** - Instant local check

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Tour Check Logic (app/dashboard/page.tsx)

**Before:**
```typescript
if (!error && data && (data as any).tour_completed) {
  // Only returned if true
  return
}
// Tour would show again if tour_completed was false
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (!error && data) {
  const tourCompleted = (data as any).tour_completed
  console.log('🔍 Database tour status:', tourCompleted)
  
  // If tour is explicitly marked as completed, never show it again
  if (tourCompleted === true) {
    console.log('✅ Tour already completed (from database)')
    setShowTour(false)  // ← Explicitly set to false
    setTourChecked(true)
    localStorage.setItem('plounix_tour_shown', 'true')  // ← Sync to localStorage
    return
  }
}
```

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Explicitly sets `setShowTour(false)` when tour is completed
- ✅ Syncs database status to localStorage for faster future checks
- ✅ Better logging to track tour status
- ✅ Handles database errors gracefully with localStorage fallback

---

### 2. Database Persistence

The `tour_completed` column in `user_profiles` table ensures:
- ✅ Tour only shows once, even if user switches devices
- ✅ Tour status persists across browser clears
- ✅ Tour status survives localStorage wipes

---

## 🗄️ Database Migration Required

**You MUST run this SQL in Supabase for the fix to work:**

```sql
-- Add tour_completed field to user_profiles table
ALTER TABLE public.user_profiles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tour_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Add a comment
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.user_profiles.tour_completed 
IS 'Whether the user has completed the interactive dashboard tour';

-- Backfill existing users (optional: set to false so they can see the tour once)
UPDATE public.user_profiles
SET tour_completed = FALSE
WHERE tour_completed IS NULL;
```

### How to Run:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Paste the SQL above
3. Click **Run**
4. Verify: `SELECT user_id, tour_completed FROM user_profiles LIMIT 10;`

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### Flow Diagram:

```
User visits dashboard
    ↓
Check if user.id exists?
    ↓
Query database: SELECT tour_completed FROM user_profiles
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Database says tour_completed = true │ → NEVER show tour again
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Database says tour_completed = false│
│ OR column doesn't exist (error)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
Check localStorage: plounix_tour_shown
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ localStorage = 'true'                │ → Sync to database, don't show tour
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Neither database nor localStorage   │ → SHOW TOUR (new user!)
│ has tour completed                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
    ↓
User completes tour
    ↓
Save to BOTH:
  1. localStorage.setItem('plounix_tour_shown', 'true')
  2. UPDATE user_profiles SET tour_completed = true
    ↓
Tour will NEVER show again for this user
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: New User (First Time)
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Run SQL: `UPDATE user_profiles SET tour_completed = FALSE WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';`
3. Refresh dashboard
4. ✅ **Expected:** Tour should show
5. Complete the tour
6. Refresh dashboard
7. ✅ **Expected:** Tour should NOT show again

### Test 2: Existing User (Already Completed)
1. Verify in database: `SELECT tour_completed FROM user_profiles WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';`
2. Should show `tour_completed = true`
3. Refresh dashboard multiple times
4. ✅ **Expected:** Tour should NEVER show

### Test 3: Cross-Device Persistence
1. Complete tour on Device A (e.g., your laptop)
2. Login on Device B (e.g., your phone)
3. ✅ **Expected:** Tour should NOT show on Device B (database synced)

### Test 4: Database Error Fallback
1. Temporarily break database connection (wrong Supabase URL)
2. Tour should fallback to localStorage
3. ✅ **Expected:** Tour shows only if localStorage doesn't have 'true'

---

## 🐛 Debugging

### Check Tour Status in Console:

You should see one of these logs:

**Scenario 1: Tour Already Completed**
```
🔍 Database tour status: true
✅ Tour already completed (from database)
```

**Scenario 2: Tour in localStorage But Not Database**
```
🔍 Database tour status: false
✅ Tour already shown (from localStorage, syncing to database...)
```

**Scenario 3: New User (Show Tour)**
```
🔍 Database tour status: false
🚀 New user detected, showing interactive tour (ONCE ONLY)
```

**Scenario 4: Database Error**
```
❌ Error checking tour status: [error details]
⚠️ Database error, checking localStorage fallback
```

### SQL Queries for Debugging:

**Check your tour status:**
```sql
SELECT user_id, email, tour_completed, created_at
FROM auth.users
LEFT JOIN user_profiles ON auth.users.id = user_profiles.user_id
WHERE auth.users.id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

**See all users who completed the tour:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as completed_count
FROM user_profiles
WHERE tour_completed = TRUE;
```

**See all users who haven't completed the tour:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as pending_count
FROM user_profiles
WHERE tour_completed IS NULL OR tour_completed = FALSE;
```

**Reset tour for specific user (for testing):**
```sql
UPDATE user_profiles
SET tour_completed = FALSE
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

**Reset tour for all users (careful!):**
```sql
UPDATE user_profiles
SET tour_completed = FALSE;
```

## 📊 Verification Checklist

After implementing the fix:

- [ ] SQL migration run successfully in Supabase
- [ ] `tour_completed` column exists in `user_profiles` table
- [ ] New user sees tour on first visit
- [ ] Tour doesn't show again after completion
- [ ] Tour status persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Tour status persists across different browsers (same account)
- [ ] Console logs show correct tour status
- [ ] localStorage has `plounix_tour_shown = 'true'` after completion
- [ ] Database has `tour_completed = true` after completion

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Tour Shows Every Time

**Symptoms:**
- Tour appears on every dashboard visit
- Console shows: "🚀 New user detected" every time

**Causes:**
1. Database column `tour_completed` doesn't exist
2. Database query is failing
3. localStorage is being cleared automatically

**Fix:**
1. Run the SQL migration above
2. Check browser console for error messages
3. Verify localStorage persists: `localStorage.getItem('plounix_tour_shown')`

### Issue 2: Tour Never Shows (Even for New Users)

**Symptoms:**
- New users don't see the tour at all
- Console shows: "✅ Tour already completed" for new users

**Causes:**
1. All users have `tour_completed = true` in database
2. localStorage has stale `plounix_tour_shown = 'true'`

**Fix:**
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Reset database: `UPDATE user_profiles SET tour_completed = FALSE WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_ID';`
3. Refresh page

### Issue 3: Tour Shows on One Device But Not Another

**Symptoms:**
- User completed tour on Device A
- Tour still shows on Device B (same account)

**Causes:**
1. Database update failed after tour completion
2. Different user accounts being used

**Fix:**
1. Check if `handleTourComplete` is being called: Look for "✅ Tour completed" log
2. Verify same user ID on both devices
3. Check database: `SELECT tour_completed FROM user_profiles WHERE user_id = 'USER_ID';`

## 🎓 Best Practices Implemented

1. **Dual-Layer Persistence**
   - Database for cross-device support
   - localStorage for instant local checks

2. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Falls back to localStorage if database fails
   - Still works even if column doesn't exist

3. **Explicit State Management**
   - `setShowTour(false)` explicitly called
   - No reliance on default values

4. **Comprehensive Logging**
   - Every decision path logs to console
   - Easy to debug tour behavior

5. **Idempotent SQL**
   - `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` - safe to run multiple times
   - Won't break if column already exists

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

The fix is working correctly when:

1. ✅ New user sees tour on **first dashboard visit**
2. ✅ Tour **never shows again** after completion
3. ✅ Tour status **persists across devices** (same account)
4. ✅ Tour status **survives browser clear** (database persistence)
5. ✅ Console logs **clearly indicate** tour status
6. ✅ No console errors related to tour
7. ✅ localStorage and database **stay in sync**

---

## 📞 Support

If tour still shows multiple times after applying this fix:

1. Check console logs for error messages
2. Verify SQL migration ran successfully
3. Confirm `tour_completed` column exists in database
4. Test with fresh browser profile (clear localStorage + cookies)
5. Check if RLS policies are blocking database updates
