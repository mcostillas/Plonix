## 🔄 The Transformation

### Your Example: iPhone Screen Damage

**BEFORE** ❌:
> "Marc, I understand that your iPhone 15 screen is damaged. You might want to consider:
> • Getting it repaired at a third-party shop
> • Looking for a paluwagan to raise funds  
> • Exploring payment plans
> Would you like me to search for repair options or prices?"

**AFTER** ✅:
> "Marc, I understand your iPhone 15 screen is damaged and you're on a budget. Let's make a smart financial plan:
> 
> First - Emergency Fund Check:
> • Do you have savings for unexpected expenses like this?
> • If not, let's start building one now
> 
> Smart Approach:
> • Save ₱600-800/week for 4-5 weeks = ₱2,400-4,000
> • Third-party repairs: ₱2,000-3,000 (much cheaper than official)
> • Use a screen protector temporarily to prevent more damage
> 
> This creates a healthy habit for future emergencies. Once you have a repair fund, aim for a ₱10,000 emergency fund (₱850/month = 1 year).
> 
> Would you like help creating a weekly savings plan?"
