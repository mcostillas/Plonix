# 🚀 NEW Product Tour Onboarding - Quick Start

## What Changed?

❌ **OLD:** 4-step form asking for age, income, avatar, and goals
✅ **NEW:** 7-step interactive tour showing what Plounix can do!

## Setup (2 steps)

### 1. Run Database Migration

Go to **Supabase SQL Editor** and run:

```sql

ALTER TABLE public.user_profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS onboarding_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

ALTER TABLE public.user_profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS onboarding_completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
```

### 2. Reset Marc Maurice's Onboarding

```sql
UPDATE public.user_profiles 
SET onboarding_completed = FALSE 
WHERE user_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM auth.users 
  WHERE raw_user_meta_data->>'name' ILIKE '%Marc%'
);
```
