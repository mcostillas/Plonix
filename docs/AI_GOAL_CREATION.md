# AI-Powered Goal Creation - Implementation Guide

## Overview
The AI assistant can now **proactively create financial goals** for users based on conversations and learning reflections. Instead of just suggesting that users should create goals, the AI can directly add them to the database.

## What Changed

### Before
```
User: "I want to save ₱50,000 for a laptop"
AI: "That's a great goal! You should create a savings goal in the Goals section..."
User: *Has to manually go to Goals page and create it*
```

### After
```
User: "I want to save ₱50,000 for a laptop"
AI: *Automatically creates the goal in database*
AI: "Excellent! I've created your 'New Laptop' goal with a ₱50,000 target. 
     Saving ₱4,200/month means you'll reach it in 12 months. 
     Want to explore ways to save faster?"
User: *Goal immediately appears in their Goals page!*
```

## Implementation Components

### 1. **API Endpoint** - `/api/goals/create/route.ts`
New endpoint that allows goal creation with:
- Input validation
- Auto-category detection from text
- Auto-icon suggestion based on category
- Auto-color assignment
- Support for AI-generated flag

**Features:**
- Detects category from keywords (e.g., "laptop" → gadget, "emergency" → emergency-fund)
- Assigns appropriate icons (📱 for gadgets, 🎓 for education, ✈️ for travel)
- Validates amounts and user IDs
- Returns created goal with full details

### 2. **AI Tool** - `create_financial_goal`
Added to LangChain agent tools with:
- Proactive usage instructions
- Required parameters: title, targetAmount
- Optional: description, category, deadline, icon, color
- Automatic userId injection from user context

**Tool Definition:**
```typescript
{
  name: "create_financial_goal",
  description: "Create a financial goal for the user directly in database",
  parameters: {
    title: string (required),
    targetAmount: number (required),
    description: string (optional),
    currentAmount: number (optional),
    category: string (optional - auto-detected),
    deadline: string (optional - YYYY-MM-DD),
    icon: string (optional - auto-selected),
    color: string (optional - auto-selected)
  }
}
```

### 3. **System Prompt Updates**
Added "GOAL CREATION FRAMEWORK" to AI instructions:

```
GOAL CREATION FRAMEWORK (CRITICAL - PROACTIVE ACTION):
1. AUTOMATICALLY create goals using create_financial_goal tool
2. DON'T just suggest - ACTUALLY CREATE IT
3. Triggers:
   - "I want to save for [something]"
   - "My goal is [amount]"
   - "I need [item]"
4. After creating: celebrate, break down savings plan, provide actions
```

### 4. **Chat Method Integration**
Added goal creation case to function execution switch:
- Extracts userId from userContext
- Calls API endpoint
- Handles success/error responses
- Returns formatted result to AI for natural response

## Auto-Detection Features
