# Learning Reflections AI Integration

## Overview
This feature connects the learning module system with the AI assistant, allowing the AI to learn from user reflections and provide more personalized financial guidance.

## How It Works

### 1. **User Completes Learning Modules**
- Users go through the Learn â†’ Apply â†’ Reflect (LAR) framework
- During the "Reflect" phase, users answer thoughtful questions about what they learned
- These reflections reveal:
  - Personal financial goals
  - Current challenges
  - Financial situation
  - Learning preferences
  - Emotional state (motivation, concerns, etc.)

### 2. **Reflections Are Automatically Saved**
- Every reflection answer (20+ characters) is saved to the database
- Saved when:
  - User finishes typing (2 second delay)
  - User moves to next question (onBlur)
- Database stores:
  - User ID
  - Module ID and title
  - Question asked
  - User's answer
  - Detected sentiment
  - Extracted insights (goals, amounts, topics, challenges)
  - Timestamp

### 3. **AI Reads Reflections for Context**
- When user chats with AI assistant, the AI retrieves:
  - Last 10 learning reflections
  - Builds comprehensive learning insights
  - Includes in personalized context
- AI now knows:
  - What modules user completed
  - User's financial goals mentioned in reflections
  - Challenges user is facing
  - Specific amounts/budgets mentioned
  - User's sentiment (motivated, concerned, confused)
  - Topics user is interested in

### 4. **Personalized AI Responses**
- AI can now:
  - Reference specific learning modules completed
  - Connect chat advice to concepts from modules
  - Address challenges mentioned in reflections
  - Celebrate progress and achievements
  - Provide relevant follow-up suggestions
  - Avoid repeating what user already learned

## Database Schema

### `learning_reflections` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE learning_reflections (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  module_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  module_title TEXT,
  phase TEXT CHECK (phase IN ('learn', 'apply', 'reflect')),
  question TEXT NOT NULL,
  answer TEXT NOT NULL,
  step_number INTEGER,
  sentiment TEXT CHECK (sentiment IN ('positive', 'neutral', 'concerned', 'motivated', 'confused')),
  extracted_insights JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
)
```

### Extracted Insights Structure
```json

- **Confused**: confused, lost, hindi alam
- **Positive**: will, going to, plan to, gagawin ko, start
- **Neutral**: Default if no keywords detected

## Insight Extraction

## AI Context Integration

### Before (Without Reflections)
```
AI only knows:
- Basic user profile
- Past chat history
- Financial context if user shared
```

### After (With Reflections)
```
AI knows:
ðŸ“š Modules Completed & User Insights:
