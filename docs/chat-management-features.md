# Chat Management Features Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the enhanced chat management features that allow users to delete individual chat sessions and clear their entire chat history.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Delete Individual Chat Session
**Location**: Trash icon in sidebar chat list  
**Function**: `deleteChat(chatId: string)`

#### What It Does:
- Deletes a specific chat session from both the database and UI
- Requires confirmation before deletion
- Prevents deletion if only one chat remains
- Only allows users to delete their own messages (security check)

#### User Flow:
1. User hovers over a chat in the sidebar
2. Trash icon appears
3. User clicks trash icon
4. Confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to delete this chat? This action cannot be undone."
5. If confirmed:
   - Deletes all messages with matching `session_id` and `user_id` from `chat_history` table
   - Removes chat from UI
   - If deleted chat was active, switches to the first remaining chat

#### Database Operations:
```sql
DELETE FROM chat_history 
WHERE session_id = ? 
AND user_id = ?
```

#### Safety Features:
- User must be logged in (`if (!user) return`)
- At least one chat must remain (`if (chats.length <= 1) return`)
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- User can only delete their own messages (`eq('user_id', user.id)`)

---

### 2. Clear All Chat History
**Location**: Settings menu → "Clear chat history" button  
**Function**: `clearAllHistory()`

#### What It Does:
- Deletes ALL chat history for the current user
- Requires double confirmation for safety
- Resets to a fresh new chat
- Optionally preserves user memories (commented out by default)

#### User Flow:
1. User clicks Settings icon in sidebar
2. Clicks "Clear chat history" option
3. First confirmation: "⚠️ WARNING: This will delete ALL your chat history and cannot be undone. Are you sure you want to continue?"
4. Second confirmation: "Are you ABSOLUTELY sure? This action is permanent."
5. If both confirmed:
   - Deletes all chat_history records for user
   - Creates fresh new chat session
   - Displays success message

#### Database Operations:
```sql
-- Delete all chat history
DELETE FROM chat_history 
WHERE user_id = ?

-- Optional: Delete all memories (commented out by default)
-- DELETE FROM user_memories 
-- WHERE user_id = ?
```

#### Safety Features:
- User must be logged in
- Double confirmation prevents accidental deletion
- Success/error alerts provide feedback
- Memory preservation option (commented code)

---

## Why Memory Deletion is Commented Out

The `clearAllHistory()` function includes commented-out code to delete user memories:

```typescript
// Optionally delete memories (commented out by default to preserve learning)
// const { error: memoryError } = await supabase
//   .from('user_memories')
//   .delete()
//   .eq('user_id', user.id)
```

**Rationale:**
- Chat history deletion is for privacy/cleanup
- User memories contain learned preferences and facts
- Clearing memories means the AI "forgets" the user completely
- Most users want to clear conversations but keep personalization
- Can be uncommented if needed for full reset

---

## Technical Implementation Details

### Function Signatures:
```typescript
const deleteChat = async (chatId: string) => Promise<void>
const clearAllHistory = async () => Promise<void>
```

### Dependencies:
- Supabase client (`@/lib/supabase`)
- User authentication state
- React state management (chats, currentChatId, messages)

### Error Handling:
Both functions include:
- Try-catch blocks for error handling
- Console error logging with emoji indicators (❌ for errors, ✅ for success)
- User-friendly alert messages
- Graceful degradation if database operations fail

### State Management:
```typescript
// After successful deletion, update UI state:
setChats(updatedChats)           // Remove from chat list
setCurrentChatId(newId)          // Switch active chat
setMessages(newMessages)         // Update message display
```

---

## Testing Scenarios

### Delete Chat:
1. ✅ Delete a chat with multiple chats available
2. ✅ Try to delete the last remaining chat (should be prevented)
3. ✅ Delete currently active chat (should switch to another)
4. ✅ Delete inactive chat (should not affect current view)
5. ✅ Cancel confirmation dialog (should do nothing)
6. ✅ Test with database error (should show error message)

### Clear All History:
1. ✅ Clear history with multiple chats
2. ✅ Cancel first confirmation (should do nothing)
3. ✅ Cancel second confirmation (should do nothing)
4. ✅ Confirm both dialogs (should clear all and create new chat)
5. ✅ Test with database error (should show error message)
6. ✅ Verify memories are preserved (check user_memories table)

## Database Requirements

### Required Tables:
1. **chat_history**
   - session_id (TEXT)
   - user_id (TEXT) ← Must be migrated
   - message_type (TEXT)
   - content (TEXT)
   - created_at (TIMESTAMP)

2. **user_memories** (optional, for cross-session memory)
   - id (UUID)
   - user_id (TEXT)
   - memory_type (TEXT)
   - key (TEXT)
   - value (TEXT)
   - importance (INTEGER)
   - created_at (TIMESTAMP)

### Migration Status:
⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The `user_id` column must be added to `chat_history` table before these features work correctly.

See migration guides:
- `docs/database-setup-guide.md`
- `docs/supabase-memory-schema.sql`
- `docs/authentication-memory-system.md`

## UI/UX Considerations

### Visual Feedback:
- **Delete Icon**: Appears on hover, red color indicates destructive action
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Standard browser `confirm()` dialogs (can be replaced with custom modals)
- **Success Messages**: Alert dialog confirms completion
- **Error Messages**: Alert dialog explains what went wrong

### Accessibility:
- Icon buttons include hover effects
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental actions
- Error messages provide clear next steps
- All actions can be canceled

### Future Enhancements:
- Replace browser dialogs with custom modal components
- Add undo functionality (soft delete with 30-day retention)
- Add export/backup before deletion
- Add batch delete (select multiple chats)
- Add archive feature (hide without deleting)

---

## Security Considerations

### User Isolation:
```typescript
.eq('user_id', user.id)  // Ensures users can only delete their own data
```

### Authentication Check:
```typescript
if (!user) return  // Prevents unauthenticated deletion
```

### Database RLS (Row Level Security):
Ensure Supabase RLS policies are enabled:
```sql
-- Policy for chat_history table
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own chats"
ON chat_history
FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id);

-- Policy for user_memories table (if implementing memory deletion)
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own memories"
ON user_memories
FOR DELETE
USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id);
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to delete chat from database"
**Cause**: Database connection error or RLS policy issue  
**Solution**: 
1. Check Supabase connection
2. Verify RLS policies are enabled
3. Check browser console for detailed error

### "Delete button not appearing"
**Cause**: TypeScript/React rendering issue  
**Solution**: 
1. Check that user is logged in
2. Verify chat list is populated
3. Check for JavaScript errors in console

### "Confirmation dialog not showing"
**Cause**: Browser popup blocker  
**Solution**: 
1. Check browser console for warnings
2. Allow popups for the site
3. Consider replacing with custom modal

### "Chat reappears after deletion"
**Cause**: Database deletion failed but UI updated  
**Solution**: 
1. Check database operation error
2. Reload page to sync with database
3. Verify RLS policies
