### i. Title 
Plounix: An AI-Powered Financial Literacy Application for Filipino Young Adults(18-25)

## Introduction 

Managing one's finances is perhaps the most fundamental of the many new duties that come with being an adult. However, the number of young people who are ill-prepared for this important role is shocking. Think about this: the World Economic Forum identified a serious problem in 2010 when it found that young people's financial literacy ratings frequently fell below 50%. This is more than simply a number; it indicates a pervasive issue, especially for individuals between the ages of 18 and 25, who are abruptly faced with making their first financial decisions in the real world. It is understandable why studies conducted by the World Bank (2021) and the OECD (2020) repeatedly show a direct correlation between inadequate financial literacy and bad budgeting, increased debt, and a discernible delay in reaching full independence.

This particular period is profoundly impactful because it marks the critical transition into economic independence. Young adults in this age group are suddenly confronted with real-world financial decisions for the very first time, moving beyond academic concepts to face immediate practical challenges like budgeting for rent, navigating student loans, securing their first credit cards, or making initial investments (Lusardi et al., 2010; Shim et al., 2010). They are often simultaneously entering the workforce, leaving parental homes, and starting to build their own financial identities. This makes the 18-25 age range a pivotal window where early financial decisions can have profound, long-lasting consequences on their entire adult lives. Research from both the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2020) and the World Bank (2021) consistently demonstrates that inadequate financial literacy within this demographic directly contributes to poor budgeting practices, escalating debt, and a discernible delay in achieving full independence.

Financial illiteracy among young adults in the Philippines remains a serious issue. A 2022 TransUnion report revealed that over half of Filipinos aged 18 to 25 anticipate difficulty in paying bills or loans on time, reflecting a lack of essential financial knowledge and skills. This gap in financial preparedness not only affects individual well-being but also poses long-term risks to national economic stability. Moreover, the study "The Value of Financial Education During Multiple Life Stages" highlights the need for continuous financial education throughout life (Gibson et al., 2021). In the Philippines, however, structured financial literacy programs are limited, especially for young adults transitioning into financial independence. Without timely and practical education, many face poor financial decision-making, debt, and economic insecurity.

In Davao City, financial illiteracy among youth remains a significant concern that reflects broader national challenges. Recent studies indicate that senior high school students in the Philippines demonstrate poor spending habits and limited financial knowledge, which hinder their ability to manage finances responsibly (Santos et al., 2023). Similarly, young adults in the country exhibit inadequate financial literacy and behaviors that increase their risk of financial instability and vulnerability (Dela Cruz & Reyes, 2021). These findings highlight the urgent need for tailored financial education programs in Davao City that address the unique challenges faced by its youth, promoting economic empowerment and long-term financial security.

Financial literacy is a fundamental skill for navigating adulthood, yet it remains a significant challenge for many young individuals globally. This is a growing concern, especially for those aged 18–25, who are transitioning into adulthood and facing real financial responsibilities for the first time. This period marks a crucial transition: young people begin earning, spending, and making big financial decisions on their own. Unlike younger students, they face immediate, real-life challenges—budgeting, borrowing, investing, and navigating government systems—that require practical skills (Lusardi et al., 2010; Shim et al., 2010). Globally, studies by the OECD and World Bank point out that low financial literacy among youth leads to poor budgeting, rising debt, and delayed independence (OECD, 2020; World Bank, 2021).

In this context, "adult success" means being able to manage money well—budgeting, saving, paying bills on time, and confidently using government services like tax filing and social security. These skills are more important than ever as the Philippines shifts toward digital government services, making it essential for young adults to have both financial and digital literacy.

Despite efforts by the Department of Education through programs like EPP, TLE, and the 2021 Financial Education Policy, a significant gap persists in equipping young Filipinos with practical financial skills for real-world scenarios. While these initiatives provide foundational knowledge, their effectiveness is often limited by several key factors. Firstly, there's a lack of consistent hands-on, practical application in critical areas such as effective budgeting, diligent saving strategies, prudent credit management, and navigating complex government financial processes. Secondly, the curriculum and delivery methods may not always be contextually relevant or sufficiently engaging for digital-native young adults who are already grappling with immediate financial responsibilities. This often leads to a disconnect between theoretical knowledge and the practical skills needed for financial independence. Consequently, many young Filipinos continue to feel unprepared for the complexities of real-world financial responsibilities.

This capstone project proposes Plounix, a web-based financial literacy application specifically designed for young Filipino adults in the Philippines. Plounix will offer interactive learning modules providing practical financial advice, complemented by real-time budgeting and saving tools to foster hands-on financial management. It aims to integrate essential digital literacy skills directly with financial tasks, ensuring users gain the practical expertise needed to navigate today's digital financial landscape effectively.
