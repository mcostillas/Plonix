# üîß HOTFIX: Bills Keyword Trigger Enhancement

## Issue Discovered (Post-Deploy)
After deploying code blocking fix, user asked:
> "can you list me my **active** monthly bills"

AI responded with code generation blocker message instead of fetching bills data:
> "I'm a financial literacy assistant, not a coding helper..."

## Root Cause
The word "list" triggered code generation detection before tool calling logic could run.

The AI had rules for:
- "what are my bills"
- "list my bills"
- "show my bills"

But NOT for:
- "list my **active** bills" ‚ùå
- "my **active** monthly bills" ‚ùå
- "show my **recurring** payments" ‚ùå

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced Tool Description
**Before:**
```
'what are my monthly bills', 'list my bills', 'show my recurring expenses'
```

**After:**
```
'what are my monthly bills', 'list my bills', 'list my active bills', 
'show my bills', 'my active monthly bills', 'show my recurring expenses', 
'my monthly bills', 'my subscriptions'
```

Added: **"ALWAYS call this when user mentions the word 'bills' in ANY context!"**

### 2. Enhanced Anti-Hallucination Rules
**Rule 2 - Added keyword triggers:**
```typescript
- Bill keywords that trigger tool call: 
  "bills", "monthly bills", "active bills", "recurring payments", "subscriptions"
- Example triggers: 
  "what are my bills", "list my bills", "show my bills", 
  "my active bills", "monthly payments"
```

**Rule 3a - Enhanced STEP 1:**
```typescript
- üö® STEP 1: When user mentions ANY of these words ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY call get_financial_summary tool!
  - Keywords: "bills", "monthly bills", "active bills", "recurring", "subscriptions", "payments"
  - Phrases: "what are my bills", "list my bills", "show my bills", "my active bills"
```

Added critical clarification:
```typescript
- DO NOT confuse "list bills" with "code generation" - they are completely different!
```

## Impact
Now ANY variation of asking for bills will trigger the tool:
- ‚úÖ "list my bills"
- ‚úÖ "list my **active** bills"
- ‚úÖ "show my **monthly** bills"
- ‚úÖ "my **recurring** payments"
- ‚úÖ "what are my **subscriptions**"

## Testing
After deployment, test:
1. "can you list me my active monthly bills" ‚Üí Should call tool and show actual bills
2. "show my recurring payments" ‚Üí Should call tool
3. "what are my subscriptions" ‚Üí Should call tool
4. "my monthly bills" ‚Üí Should call tool

All should return: Internet ‚Ç±5,000, Rent ‚Ç±4,000, Netflix ‚Ç±149
