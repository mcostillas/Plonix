# AI Function Call Display Bug Fix

## Date: October 11, 2025

## Issue

**Problem:** Fili was showing function call syntax in chat responses instead of executing tools silently and showing only the results.

**Example of Bug:**
```
User: "Create a goal for ₱2,000 in 2 weeks"

Fili's Response (WRONG):
"Perfect! We'll set your savings goal for ₱2,000 to be achieved in 2 weeks.

I'll create this goal now.

Call create_financial_goal({userId: userContext.id, title: "Savings Goal for Video Editing Earnings", targetAmount: 2000, deadline: "2025-04-25"})

Great! I've created your savings goal for ₱2,000 with a deadline of 2 weeks from now."
```

**What Should Happen:**
```
Fili's Response (CORRECT):
"Perfect! We'll set your savings goal for ₱2,000 to be achieved in 2 weeks.

Great! I've created your savings goal for ₱2,000 with a deadline of 2 weeks from now. You can track your progress in your Goals page. If you need tips on how to save effectively, just let me know!"
```

## Root Cause

The system prompt contained example responses that showed function calls using syntax like:
- `*Call create_financial_goal(...)*`
- `→ Call add_expense(...)`
- `*Get result with all data*`

The AI was mimicking these examples and including the function call syntax in its actual responses to users, which:
1. Looked unprofessional and confusing
2. Exposed internal implementation details
3. Made it seem like the tool wasn't working (even though it was executing correctly)

## Solution

### 1. Removed All Visible Function Call Examples

**Before:**
```typescript
User: "in 3 months"
*Call create_financial_goal({userId: userContext.id, title: "Savings Goal", targetAmount: 10000, deadline: "2025-04-11"})*
Response: "Perfect! ✓ I've created your ₱10,000 Savings Goal..."
```

**After:**
```typescript
User: "in 3 months"
Response: "Perfect! ✓ I've created your ₱10,000 Savings Goal with a 3-month deadline..."
```

### 2. Added Explicit Instructions

Added multiple warnings throughout the system prompt:

```typescript
**IMPORTANT: NEVER show function calls like '*Call tool_name(...)*' or '→ Call...' in your responses. Tools execute silently behind the scenes. Only show the result.**
```

**Added at key locations:**
1. After goal creation framework (~line 791)
2. In deadline parsing guide (~line 1038)
3. In goal creation examples (~line 1242)
4. In transaction flow examples (~line 1319)
5. In general tool usage rules (~line 851)

### 3. Cleaned Up All Example Responses

**Changed sections:**
- Goal creation examples
- Financial summary examples  
- Transaction tracking examples
- Monthly bill examples
- Learning progress examples

**Pattern changed from:**
```
*Call tool_name({params})*
*Get result*
Response: "..."
```

**To:**
```
Response: "..." (tool executes automatically)
```

## Files Modified

### lib/langchain-agent.ts
- Lines ~791: Added warning in goal creation framework
- Lines ~851-945: Removed function call syntax from financial summary examples
- Lines ~970-1010: Removed function call syntax from reflection examples
- Lines ~1038: Added warning in deadline parsing
- Lines ~1230-1242: Removed and added warning in goal conversation examples
- Lines ~1310-1327: Removed function call syntax from transaction examples

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Goal Creation
```
User: "I want to save ₱2,000 for video editing in 2 weeks"
Fili: "Great goal! Let me help you set that up. When would you like to achieve this?"
User: "In 2 weeks"
Fili: "Perfect! ✓ I've created your ₱2,000 savings goal with a 2-week deadline..."
```
✅ No function call text shown

### Test Case 2: Add Income
```
User: "I got paid ₱5,000"
Fili: "Great! ✓ I've recorded your ₱5,000 income..."
```
✅ No function call text shown

### Test Case 3: Check Balance
```
User: "What's my total income?"
Fili: "Your total income is ₱7,000..."
```
✅ No function call text shown

### Test Case 4: Add Monthly Bill
```
User: "My rent is ₱8,000 on the 5th"
Fili: "✓ Set up monthly rent bill of ₱8,000 due on day 5..."
```
✅ No function call text shown

## Technical Details

**Why This Happened:**
- OpenAI's GPT models learn from examples in the system prompt
- When examples show `*Call function(...)*`, the AI mimics this pattern
- The AI thought it was supposed to show its "thought process" to users

**Why The Fix Works:**
1. **Removes Bad Examples:** No more examples showing function call syntax
2. **Explicit Instructions:** Multiple clear warnings not to show function calls
3. **Good Examples:** All examples now show only user-facing responses
4. **Consistency:** Applied across all tool examples (goals, transactions, bills, etc.)

## Example Prompts That Now Work Correctly

### Goal Creation
- "I want to save ₱5,000"
- "Create a goal for ₱10,000 in 3 months"
- "Help me save for a laptop"

### Transaction Tracking
- "I spent ₱500 on food"
- "I received ₱20,000 salary"
- "Paid ₱2,000 for electric bill"

### Data Queries
- "What's my total income?"
- "How much have I saved?"
- "Show my monthly bills"

All of these should now execute the appropriate tools silently and show only the result to the user.

## Benefits

1. **Professional Appearance:** No technical jargon in user-facing responses
2. **User Confidence:** Users see results, not debug information
3. **Cleaner Interface:** Chat looks polished and production-ready
4. **Less Confusion:** Users understand what happened without seeing implementation details

## Related Issues

This fix also addresses:
- Tool execution appearing to "not work" when it actually was working
- Users thinking the AI is broken when seeing technical syntax
- Responses being too verbose with unnecessary debug info

## Status
✅ COMPLETE - All function call display instances removed from system prompt

## Notes

The actual tool execution was always working correctly - the issue was purely cosmetic but affected user experience significantly. The tools still execute in the exact same way, users just don't see the internal mechanics anymore.
