# Chat Management Features - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. Delete Individual Chat Sessions
**How to use:**
1. Hover over any chat in the sidebar
2. Click the trash icon that appears
3. Confirm deletion

**What happens:**
- Chat is deleted from both database and UI
- If you delete the active chat, it switches to another one
- You can't delete the last remaining chat (minimum 1 required)
- Confirmation prevents accidental deletion

---

### 2. Clear All Chat History
**How to use:**
1. Click the Settings icon in the sidebar
2. Click "Clear chat history"
3. Confirm twice (it's a destructive action!)

**What happens:**
- ALL your chat history is permanently deleted
- A fresh new chat is created
- Your learned memories are preserved (AI still remembers your preferences)

## 🚀 Testing Instructions

### Test Delete Chat:
1. Create multiple chat sessions (click "New Chat" button)
2. Type something in each to generate history
3. Hover over a chat in the sidebar
4. Click the trash icon
5. Confirm the deletion
6. ✅ Chat should disappear from both UI and database

### Test Clear All History:
1. Open Settings menu (gear icon)
2. Click "Clear chat history"
3. Confirm both dialogs
4. ✅ All chats should be cleared, new one created

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Database Migration Required
Before these features work, you MUST run the pending SQL migrations:

1. **user_id column**: Needed for user isolation
2. **user_memories table**: Needed for cross-session memory (optional for chat deletion)

**How to migrate:**
1. Open Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run the migrations from `docs/supabase-memory-schema.sql`

See full instructions in `docs/database-setup-guide.md`

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ Users can only delete their own chats
- ✅ Authentication required for all operations
- ✅ Double confirmation for destructive actions
- ✅ User ID verification on database level
- ✅ Row Level Security policies recommended

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to delete chat from database"
- Check if SQL migrations are completed
- Verify Supabase connection
- Check browser console for errors

### Delete button not appearing
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check that you have multiple chats (can't delete last one)
- Try refreshing the page

### Confirmation dialogs not showing
- Check browser popup blocker
- Look for JavaScript errors in console
