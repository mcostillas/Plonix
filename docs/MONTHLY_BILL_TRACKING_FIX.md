# Monthly Bill Tracking Enhancement

## Date: October 11, 2025

## Issue

**Problem:** When users asked Fili to add monthly bills (recurring expenses), the tool wasn't being triggered properly or wasn't clear about what information was needed.

**User Reports:**
- "Add monthly bill if not working as well whenever I ask it to add a monthly bill"

## Root Cause

The `add_monthly_bill` tool existed and was implemented correctly, but:
1. The system prompt lacked explicit instructions on **when** to use this tool
2. No clear examples of the conversation flow for adding monthly bills
3. Tool description wasn't prominent enough with keywords that trigger it
4. Missing guidance on asking for required parameters (name, amount, category, due day)

## Solution

### 1. Added Dedicated Monthly Bill Section in System Prompt

**New section added after transaction flow (~line 1018):**

```typescript
**When to use add_monthly_bill:**
User mentions recurring monthly expenses, bills that repeat every month:
- "My rent is 8000 on the 5th"
- "I pay 2000 for electricity every month on the 10th"
- "My Netflix subscription is 500 monthly"
- "I have a 1500 insurance payment every 1st"
- "Set up my recurring bills"
- "Track my monthly subscriptions"

**Monthly Bill Flow:**
1. Acknowledge the recurring bill
2. **ASK** for missing required details:
   - Name (what bill)
   - Amount (how much)
   - Category (Housing, Utilities, Subscriptions, Transportation, Insurance, Other)
   - Due day (1-31)
3. Call add_monthly_bill tool
4. After success, provide:
   - Confirmation of bill added
   - Reminder about tracking
   - Total monthly obligations if applicable

Example:
User: "My rent is â‚±8,000 on the 5th"
Response: "âœ“ Set up monthly rent bill of â‚±8,000 due on day 5. I'll help you track this every month! This will remind you before it's due."

User: "I pay internet 1500 monthly"
Response: "Got it! When is your internet bill usually due each month? (day 1-31)"
User: "Every 15th"
Response: "âœ“ Set up monthly internet bill of â‚±1,500 due on day 15 (Utilities category). You'll get reminders before it's due!"
```

### 2. Enhanced Tool Description

**Before:**
```typescript
description: "Add a recurring monthly bill for the user. Use when user mentions setting up automatic bills..."
```

**After:**
```typescript
description: "**USE THIS TOOL** when user mentions recurring monthly expenses, bills, or subscriptions that repeat every month. Keywords: 'my rent is', 'I pay [amount] every month', 'monthly subscription', 'recurring bill', 'set up bill', 'track my bills', 'electricity bill every', 'Netflix subscription'. Add a recurring monthly bill for the user..."
```
