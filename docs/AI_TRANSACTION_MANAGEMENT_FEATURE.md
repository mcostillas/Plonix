# AI Transaction Management Feature

## Overview
The AI Assistant (Fili) can now list and edit transactions directly through conversation. Users can ask to see their transaction history and modify existing transactions without leaving the chat interface.

- "What are my recent transactions?"
- "List all my income"

**Example interaction**:
```
User: "Show me my transactions"

AI: "Here are your recent transactions:

2. â‚±150 - Grab - Transportation - Jun 14

### AI Agent Tools

#### Tool: `list_transactions`
**Function**: Fetch and display transaction history

**Parameters**:
- `category` (optional): Filter by category
- `startDate` (optional): Start date in YYYY-MM-DD
- `endDate` (optional): End date in YYYY-MM-DD  
- `limit` (optional): Max transactions to return (default: 50)

**When AI calls this**:
- User asks to see transactions
- User requests spending history
- User wants to review specific category
- Before editing a transaction (to show options)

#### Tool: `update_transaction`
**Function**: Modify existing transaction

**Parameters**:
- `transactionId` (required): ID of transaction to update
- `amount` (optional): New amount
- `category` (optional): New category
- `merchant` (optional): New description
- `date` (optional): New date in YYYY-MM-DD
- `paymentMethod` (optional): New payment method
- `notes` (optional): New notes
- `transactionType` (optional): Change to income/expense

**When AI calls this**:
- User wants to edit a transaction
- User wants to fix an error
- User wants to update details

## Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: Both endpoints require Bearer token authentication
2. **User Isolation**: Transactions are filtered by `user_id` - users can only see/edit their own
3. **RLS Protection**: Supabase Row Level Security ensures data isolation
4. **Service Role Access**: AI uses service role key for database queries (bypasses RLS when needed)

## Usage Flow

### Listing Transactions
1. User asks: "Show my transactions"
2. AI calls `list_transactions` tool
3. AI receives transaction data + summary
4. AI formats response in readable format
5. AI provides insights (e.g., "You're within budget for food")

### Editing Transactions
1. User asks: "Edit my transaction"
2. AI calls `list_transactions` to show recent transactions
3. AI asks which transaction to edit
4. User identifies transaction (by amount, date, or merchant)
5. AI asks what to change
6. User specifies changes
7. AI calls `update_transaction` with transaction ID + updates
8. AI confirms change with before/after comparison

## Benefits

1. **Convenience**: No need to leave chat to manage transactions
2. **Natural Language**: Edit transactions by describing them naturally
3. **Context-Aware**: AI provides insights while showing transactions
4. **Quick Fixes**: Easily correct mistakes or update details
5. **Financial Insights**: AI analyzes spending patterns while listing transactions

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Delete transaction via AI
- Bulk update transactions
- Search transactions by keywords
- Export transactions to CSV/PDF via AI command
- Set up recurring transactions via AI
- Transaction categorization suggestions from AI
