# New User Experience & AI Query Fix

## Date: October 11, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Fili Adding Income Instead of Checking Balance
**Problem:** When user asked "What is my total income?" after adding ₱2,000 and ₱5,000, Fili incorrectly added another ₱2,000 instead of querying the database, resulting in ₱9,000 instead of ₱7,000.

**Root Cause:** The `get_financial_summary` tool was not available in the chat function's tools array - it only existed in the older LangChain agent tools, but the current implementation uses a direct OpenAI function calling approach with a separate tools array.

**Solution:**
1. Added `get_financial_summary` tool to the chat function's tools array
2. Strengthened the tool description to explicitly state it should be used for querying (not adding)
3. Added handler in the switch statement to execute the tool
4. Tool now queries all user financial data from database:
   - Transactions (income/expenses)
   - Goals progress
   - Learning modules completed
   - Active challenges
   - Monthly bills

**Tool Description:**
```typescript
{
  name: "get_financial_summary",
  description: "**CRITICAL TOOL - USE WHEN USER ASKS ABOUT THEIR FINANCIAL DATA** Get comprehensive financial summary including income, expenses, balance, goals progress, learning modules completed, active challenges, and monthly bills. **USE THIS TO QUERY/CHECK USER'S DATA - DO NOT use add_income or add_expense tools when user is asking 'what is my income?' or 'how much did I earn?'.** Keywords that MUST trigger this tool: 'what is my', 'how much is my', 'check my', 'show my', 'what's my total', 'my current', 'look at my', 'see my'. Required: userId."
}
```

**Keywords That Trigger Query (Not Add):**
- "what is my income"
- "how much did I earn"
- "check my balance"
- "show my expenses"
- "what's my total income"
- "look at my transactions"
- "see my financial data"

### Issue 2: Dashboard Always Says "Welcome Back" for New Users
**Problem:** Even for brand new users who just completed onboarding, the dashboard greeting said "Welcome back" which felt impersonal and didn't acknowledge their first-time experience.

**Solution:**
1. Added new user detection based on onboarding completion timestamp
2. Store `plounix_onboarding_time` in localStorage when user completes onboarding
3. Dashboard checks if onboarding was completed within last 24 hours
4. Show different greeting for new users vs returning users

**Implementation:**

**Onboarding Page (`app/onboarding/page.tsx`):**
```typescript
// When completing onboarding
localStorage.setItem('plounix_onboarding_completed', 'true')
localStorage.setItem('plounix_onboarding_time', Date.now().toString())
```

**Dashboard Page (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`):**
```typescript
const [isNewUser, setIsNewUser] = useState(false)

useEffect(() => {
  const onboardingTime = localStorage.getItem('plounix_onboarding_time')
  if (onboardingTime) {
    const timeSinceOnboarding = Date.now() - parseInt(onboardingTime)
    const oneDay = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
    if (timeSinceOnboarding < oneDay) {
      setIsNewUser(true)
    }
  }
}, [user, router])
```

**Greeting Display:**
```tsx
<h1>
  {isNewUser ? (
    <>Welcome to Plounix, {user?.name}! 🎉</>
  ) : (
    <>Welcome back, {user?.name}!</>
  )}
</h1>
<p>
  {isNewUser 
    ? "Let's start building your financial future together!" 
    : "Ready to level up your financial game today?"}
</p>
```

### Issue 3: Fili Says "Welcome Back" to New Users
**Problem:** When a new user first chats with Fili, the AI would say generic things like "Glad to have you back" or just start answering questions without introducing itself.

**Solution:**
1. Detect if user has no previous messages (empty `recentMessages` array)
2. Add special instructions to system prompt for first-time interactions
3. Fili now introduces itself with capabilities on first message

**Implementation (`lib/langchain-agent.ts`):**
```typescript
async chat(userId: string, message: string, userContext?: any, recentMessages: any[] = []): Promise<string> {
  // Detect if this is a new user (no previous messages)
  const isNewUser = !recentMessages || recentMessages.length === 0
  
  const systemPrompt = `You are Fili - a Filipino financial literacy assistant focused on building smart money habits.

${isNewUser ? `
🎉 **IMPORTANT: THIS IS A NEW USER'S FIRST MESSAGE!**

When responding to this first message, you MUST:
1. Give a warm, welcoming introduction of yourself
2. Briefly explain what you can help with (3-4 key capabilities)
3. Then address their question/message
4. Keep it friendly but professional

Example first response:
"Hi! I'm Fili, your personal financial assistant! 🤗

I'm here to help you with:
- 💰 Tracking income & expenses
- 🎯 Setting and achieving savings goals
- 📚 Learning financial literacy
- 🔍 Finding current prices and financial info
- 💡 Personalized money advice

[Then address their actual message...]

Now, what can I help you with today?"

After the first interaction, you can be more conversational and skip the introduction.
` : ''}

CORE MISSION: FINANCIAL LITERACY FIRST
...`
```

**Example New User Interaction:**

**User (first message):** "Hi"

**Fili:** 
```
Hi! I'm Fili, your personal financial assistant! 🤗

I'm here to help you with:
- 💰 Tracking income & expenses
- 🎯 Setting and achieving savings goals
- 📚 Learning financial literacy
- 🔍 Finding current prices and financial info
- 💡 Personalized money advice

I can help you save smarter, spend wiser, and reach your financial goals. 

What can I help you with today? Maybe track your first transaction, set a savings goal, or learn about budgeting?
```

**User (second message):** "What's my income?"

**Fili:** (No introduction, just answers)
```
Let me check your current income...

[Calls get_financial_summary tool]

You currently have ₱0 in income. Let's get started tracking! Would you like to add your first income transaction?
```

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

1. **lib/langchain-agent.ts**
   - Added `get_financial_summary` to tools array (line ~1355)
   - Added tool handler in switch statement (line ~1570)
   - Added new user detection and introduction prompt (line ~1100)
   - Strengthened tool descriptions to prevent confusion between query and add actions

2. **app/dashboard/page.tsx**
   - Added `isNewUser` state variable
   - Added logic to detect new users based on onboarding timestamp
   - Updated welcome header to show different messages for new vs returning users

3. **app/onboarding/page.tsx**
   - Added `plounix_onboarding_time` to localStorage when completing onboarding

### Testing Scenarios

**Scenario 1: User Asking About Income (Fixed)**
```
User: "I added ₱2,000 income"
Fili: [Calls add_income] ✓ Added ₱2,000 income

User: "I added ₱5,000 remittance"
Fili: [Calls add_income] ✓ Added ₱5,000 income

User: "What's my total income?"
Fili: [Calls get_financial_summary - NOT add_income!]
      "Your total income is ₱7,000"
```

**Before Fix:**
- Fili would call `add_income` again, adding ₱2,000 (total becomes ₱9,000) ❌

**After Fix:**
- Fili calls `get_financial_summary` to query database (correct total: ₱7,000) ✓

**Scenario 2: New User Dashboard**
```
1. User completes onboarding
2. Redirected to dashboard
3. Dashboard shows: "Welcome to Plounix, [Name]! 🎉"
4. Subtitle: "Let's start building your financial future together!"
5. After 24 hours, changes to: "Welcome back, [Name]!"
```

**Scenario 3: New User Chatting with Fili**
```
1. New user opens AI assistant for first time
2. Types: "Hello"
3. Fili responds with introduction:
   - "Hi! I'm Fili, your personal financial assistant!"
   - Lists capabilities (tracking, goals, learning, prices, advice)
   - Then asks what they need help with
4. User continues conversation
5. Fili responds normally without repeating introduction
```
