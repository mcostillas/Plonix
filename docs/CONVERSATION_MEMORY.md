# 🧠 Per-User AI Conversation Memory System

## Overview
Plounix's AI assistant (Fili) now has a **per-user conversation memory system** that remembers all past conversations for each authenticated user.

---

## ✨ Features

### 1. **Persistent Conversation History**
- Every message between user and AI is stored in Supabase `chat_history` table
- Conversations persist across sessions - close the browser, come back, AI remembers!
- Each user has isolated memory - User A's conversations are private from User B

### 2. **Automatic Context Loading**
- When user starts a chat, AI automatically loads last 20 messages
- AI uses conversation history to provide contextual responses
- No need to repeat information - AI remembers what you told it before

### 3. **Authentication-Based**
- Memory only works for **logged-in users**
- Anonymous users get generic responses (no memory)
- Encourages user registration for personalized experience

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE chat_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id TEXT NOT NULL,     -- User ID
  message_type TEXT NOT NULL,    -- 'human' or 'ai'
  content TEXT NOT NULL,         -- Message content
  metadata JSONB,                -- Additional data
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Core Components

#### 1. **authenticated-memory.ts**
Main memory manager that:
- Validates user authentication
- Loads past conversations from database
- Stores new messages to database
- Provides conversation context to AI

#### 2. **user-context-builder.ts** (Future Enhancement)
Gathers user data for personalized responses:
- Transaction history
- Financial goals
- Learning progress
- Challenges joined

#### 3. **API Route: /api/ai-chat**
Handles AI conversations with memory:
```typescript
POST /api/ai-chat
Body: { message: "User question" }
Response: { response: "AI answer", memoryEnabled: true }
```

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### For Authenticated Users:

1. **User sends message** → "How should I budget?"
2. **System loads past conversations** from `chat_history`
3. **AI receives context**:
   ```
   Previous conversation:
   User: I make ₱25,000 per month
   AI: Great! Let's create a budget...
   
   Current message: How should I budget?
   ```
4. **AI responds** with personalized advice based on past context
5. **Both messages saved** to database for future reference

### For Anonymous Users:

1. User sends message → "How should I budget?"
2. **No conversation history loaded** (not logged in)
3. AI receives only current message
4. AI provides general advice + encourages login
5. **Messages NOT saved** (no persistence)

## 📊 Memory System Flow

```
User Login → Authentication Check → Load Past Conversations
                                         ↓
                                    Build Context
                                         ↓
User Message → Add to Context → Send to OpenAI
                                         ↓
                                   Get AI Response
                                         ↓
                          Save Both Messages to Database
                                         ↓
                                    Display to User
```

## 🧪 Testing the Memory System

### Test Scenario: Memory Persistence

**Step 1: First Conversation**
```
User: "Hi, I make ₱25,000 per month"
AI: "Great! With ₱25,000, I can help you create a budget..."
```

**Step 2: Close browser / Logout & Login**

**Step 3: New Conversation (Same User)**
```
User: "How should I split my salary?"
AI: "Based on your ₱25,000 monthly income you mentioned earlier, 
     I recommend the 50-30-20 rule:
     - ₱12,500 for needs
     - ₱7,500 for wants
     - ₱5,000 for savings"
```

**✅ AI remembered the ₱25,000 from previous session!**

---

## 🎨 User Interface

### Memory Status Indicator:
- **Blue badge** with "Memory Active" shown when logged in
- **Shield icon** to indicate data is being remembered
- Appears in AI assistant header

### For Developers:
- Check browser console for memory logs:
  - "Loading X previous messages for user..."
  - "✅ Built complete context for user..."
  - "Cleared memory for user..."

---

## 📝 API Endpoints

### Check Memory Status
```bash
GET /api/memory-status
Authorization: Required (logged in)

Response:
{
  "userId": "uuid",
  "hasMemory": true,
  "memoryCount": 15,
  "profile": {...}
}
```

### View User Context (What AI Sees)
```bash
GET /api/user-context
Authorization: Required

Response:
{
  "contextData": {...},
  "aiPromptContext": "Formatted context string",
  "summary": {
    "hasTransactions": false,
    "hasGoals": false,
    "hasAnyData": true
  }
}
```

### Clear Memory
```bash
DELETE /api/memory-status
Authorization: Required

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "All user memory cleared"
}
```

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

### Row-Level Security (RLS):
- Each user can only access their own conversations
- Database enforces user_id matching for queries
- No cross-user data leakage

### Data Isolation:
```sql
-- Users only see their own data
session_id = auth.uid()
user_id = auth.uid()
```

### Clear Memory Option:
- Users can delete all their conversation history
- Privacy-first approach

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Users:
1. **Login before chatting** to enable memory
2. **Share context naturally** in conversation (income, goals, etc.)
3. **Reference past conversations** - AI will remember
4. **Use consistently** for better personalization

### For Developers:
1. **Always check authentication** before memory operations
2. **Handle empty memory gracefully** (new users)
3. **Log memory operations** for debugging
4. **Test with multiple users** to verify isolation

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: AI doesn't remember past conversations
**Solutions:**
- Verify user is logged in (check "Memory Active" badge)
- Check browser console for memory loading logs
- Verify `chat_history` table has data in Supabase
- Ensure OpenAI API key is configured

### Problem: Memory from other users appearing
**Solutions:**
- Check RLS policies in Supabase
- Verify session_id matches user ID
- Clear browser cache and re-login

### Problem: Old conversations not loading
**Solutions:**
- Check database connection in .env.local
- Verify Supabase credentials are correct
- Check `loadExistingMessages` limit (currently 20)
