# üö® RESTART SERVER REQUIRED

## Why?
The AI agent is still using the OLD code from memory. The new fixes for:
1. ‚úÖ Blocking code generation
2. ‚úÖ Accurate monthly bills listing

...are in the GitHub code but NOT loaded in the running AI yet.

## How to Fix (SIMPLE):

### Option 1: Restart Dev Server (RECOMMENDED)
```powershell
# 1. Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
# 2. Start fresh:
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Hard Restart Everything
```powershell
# Kill all node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

## What This Will Do:
- ‚úÖ Load the NEW langchain-agent.ts with updated rules
- ‚úÖ AI will stop providing code examples
- ‚úÖ AI will list bills accurately using the allBills array data
- ‚úÖ All other fixes will work (deadline calculation, check-in values, etc.)

## Verification After Restart:
1. Ask AI: "list my monthly bills"
   - Should show: Internet ‚Ç±5,000, Rent ‚Ç±4,000, Netflix ‚Ç±149
   - NOT: Internet ‚Ç±1,500, Rent ‚Ç±8,000, Electricity ‚Ç±649

2. Ask AI: "teach me a simple expense tracker code"
   - Should say: "I'm a financial literacy assistant, not a coding helper!"
   - NOT: Provide Python code

## Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Code is in GitHub (commit c546e08)
- ‚úÖ Files are correct (no TypeScript errors)
- ‚ùå Server needs restart to load changes
- ‚ùå AI is using old cached version

## IMPORTANT:
**This is NOT a bug in the code - it's just that the AI hasn't restarted yet!**
The fixes are perfect, they just need to be loaded into memory.
