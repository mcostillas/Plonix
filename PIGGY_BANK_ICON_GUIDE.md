## 💡 Pro Tip

**Keep it SUPER simple.** Think about:
- Twitter icon (just a bird)
- Facebook icon (just an 'f')
- Instagram icon (just a camera)

Your piggy bank should be equally simple - just the essential shape that says "money" or "savings."

**Good:** 🐷 (simple silhouette)  
**Bad:** 🐷💰💵🏦 (too busy, unreadable when small)

---

## 🎨 Color Testing

Test your icon on different backgrounds:
- ✅ White background (website)
- ✅ Black background (dark mode)
- ✅ Green background (PWA splash screen)
- ✅ Phone home screen

Make sure it's visible and looks good on ALL of them!
