**Essential Insurance for Filipino Youth:**

**1. PhilHealth (Government Health Insurance):**
• Mandatory for employees, voluntary for others
• Covers basic medical expenses, hospitalization
• Premium: 4.5% of income (shared with employer if employed)

**2. SSS (Social Security System):**
• Retirement, disability, death benefits
• Monthly premium based on salary bracket
• Provides pension starting age 60-65

**3. Life Insurance:**
• Protects family if you pass away unexpectedly
• Term life: Pure protection, lower cost
• VUL (Variable Universal Life): Insurance + investment

**Medical Insurance Beyond PhilHealth:**
• HMO from employer: Covers more medical services
• Personal health insurance: Fill gaps in coverage

**Cost Examples (25-year-old):**
• Term life insurance (₱1M coverage): ₱3,000-5,000 annually
• Personal accident insurance: ₱1,500-3,000 annually`,
