# üö® CRITICAL STATUS REPORT - Batch 2 Bugs (Still In Progress)

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** üî¥ CRITICAL - Multiple deployment attempts, still broken in production

---

## üìä Current Situation

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- **Mamerto's Account:** Bills query works! AI calls tool and responds (but hallucinates data)
- **Code Blocking:** Working on new deployments (Mamerto confirmed)
- **Language Matching:** Needs verification but code is in place

### ‚ùå What's STILL Broken:
- **Marc Maurice's Account:** "list my monthly bills" ‚Üí Still shows code blocking message
- **Data Hallucination:** AI says "‚Ç±4,000" then "‚Ç±64,000" instead of listing actual bills
- **Inconsistent Deployment:** Different accounts seeing different code versions

## üêõ Bug Analysis

### Bug #1: Bills Query Blocked as "Code Request"
**Status:** üü° PARTIALLY FIXED (works for Mamerto, not Marc)

**Root Cause Found:**
- TWO tool definition systems (OLD DynamicTool vs NEW OpenAI Functions)
- We edited OLD definition (not used), NEW definition was missing keywords
- Code blocking Rule 0b firing before bills keyword check

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Added bills keywords to NEW tool definition (line 1513)
2. Added CRITICAL EXCEPTION to Rule 0b
3. Added CRITICAL DISTINCTION section (code vs data queries)

**Evidence It Works:**
- Mamerto's account: "list my monthly bills" ‚Üí Calls tool successfully
- No more "I'm not a coding helper" on Mamerto

**Evidence It's Still Broken:**
- Marc Maurice (incognito): Still getting code blocking message
- Suggests Vercel hasn't deployed latest code to all instances

### Bug #2: Data Hallucination
**Status:** üî¥ NOT FIXED YET

**Symptoms:**
- AI says "ang monthly bills mo ay ‚Ç±4,000" (only total, no breakdown)
- Then says "‚Ç±64,000" (wrong total)
- Doesn't list individual bills (Internet, Rent, Netflix)
- Confuses bills with income/expenses

**Root Cause:** AI is reading `totalMonthlyAmount` but NOT `allBills` array

**What We Already Have:**
- Rule 3a: "use monthlyBills.allBills array from get_financial_summary"
- Rule 3a: "List EACH bill with ACTUAL name and ACTUAL amount"
- Rule 3a: "Format: '1. [name]: ‚Ç±[amount]'"

**Why It's Still Broken:**
- Rules are there but AI ignores them
- Might need even MORE explicit instruction
- Or validation layer to catch this

### Bug #3: Language Switching
**Status:** üü¢ LIKELY FIXED (needs testing)

**Fix Applied:**
- Rule #0: Language Consistency (analyze user message first, match exact language)
- Enhanced language instructions for Taglish mode
- 5 critical rules in üåê LANGUAGE CONSISTENCY RULE section

**Needs Testing:**
- English input ‚Üí English output
- Filipino input ‚Üí Filipino output
- No mid-conversation switching

## üéØ Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Wait for Vercel Deployment
- **Started:** Just now (commit fee8505)
- **Expected:** 2-3 minutes
- **Check:** https://vercel.com/dashboard

### Step 2: Test Marc Maurice (Incognito)
After deployment complete:
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Type: "list my monthly bills"
3. **Expected:** Should call tool (not code blocking)
4. **If still broken:** Check Vercel logs for errors

### Step 3: Fix Data Hallucination
**IF bills query works but data is wrong:**
1. AI is calling tool ‚úÖ
2. Tool returns correct data ‚úÖ (from database)
3. **AI is not parsing the response correctly** ‚ùå

**Solution:** Need to make Rule 3a even MORE explicit:
```typescript
- When monthlyBills.allBills = [{name: "Internet", amount: 5000}, {name: "Rent", amount: 4000}]
- You MUST say: "1. Internet: ‚Ç±5,000" and "2. Rent: ‚Ç±4,000"
- DO NOT just say the total
- DO NOT make up different amounts
- READ EACH ITEM in the allBills array
```

## üîß Technical Debt

### Architecture Issues Found:
1. **Duplicate Tool Definitions** - OLD (line 361) vs NEW (line 1513)
   - Confusing, error-prone
   - Should remove OLD or auto-sync

2. **Too Many Rule Layers** - Rules in 3+ places:
   - TOPIC BOUNDARIES (line 770)
   - CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES (line 1295)
   - System prompt (line 1390)
   - Tool descriptions (line 361, 1513)

3. **No Response Validation for Data** - Validator checks:
   - ‚úÖ Fake YouTube links
   - ‚úÖ Code syntax
   - ‚ùå NOT checking if bills are listed correctly
   - ‚ùå NOT checking if data matches tool response

### Recommended Refactors:
1. Remove OLD DynamicTool definitions (not used)
2. Consolidate rules into ONE authoritative section
3. Add data accuracy validator
4. Add tool response parser validation

## üìù Test Checklist (After Deployment)

### Test Account: Marc Maurice
- [ ] "list my monthly bills" ‚Üí Calls tool (not code blocking)
- [ ] Lists actual bills: Internet ‚Ç±5,000, Rent ‚Ç±4,000, Netflix ‚Ç±149
- [ ] Responds in English (user wrote in English)
- [ ] Shows individual bills, not just total

### Test Account: Mamerto  
- [ ] "list my monthly bills" ‚Üí Already calls tool ‚úÖ
- [ ] Lists actual bills correctly (currently wrong - hallucinates)
- [ ] Responds in Filipino (user wrote in Filipino) ‚úÖ
- [ ] Consistent across multiple requests

### Code Blocking (Both Accounts)
- [ ] "write me Python code" ‚Üí Blocks correctly
- [ ] "generate HTML" ‚Üí Blocks correctly
- [ ] "list my bills" ‚Üí Does NOT block (calls tool)

## üé¨ Next Steps

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for Vercel deployment (fee8505)
2. **Test Marc Maurice** in incognito with hard refresh
3. **IF bills query works:** Fix data hallucination issue
4. **IF still blocked:** Check Vercel deployment logs, might need manual intervention
5. **Create validation layer** to catch hallucinated bill data

---

## üò§ Frustration Log

**Total Time Spent:** ~2 hours  
**Commits Made:** 8  
**Rebuilds Triggered:** 3  
**Issues Fixed:** 2/5 partially  
**Issues Remaining:** 3 critical  

**Biggest Challenges:**
1. Found wrong tool definition after 1 hour
2. Code blocking interfering with data queries
3. Vercel slow to deploy (5+ minutes per rebuild)
4. Can't test locally (need production to verify)
5. AI hallucinating data even when tool returns correct info

---

## üí° Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify which code path is executing** (OLD vs NEW)
2. **Test in production immediately** after push
3. **Use incognito for clean testing** (no cache issues)
4. **Vercel deployments take 5+ minutes** - not instant
5. **Rules can conflict** - need explicit exceptions
6. **AI can ignore rules** - need validation layers too

---

**Current Priority:** Get bills query working on ALL accounts, then fix hallucination.
